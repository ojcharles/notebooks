To date, there are no reports identifying SARS-CoV-2 RDV resistance in patients, animal models or in vitro. Here, we selected drug-resistant viral populations by serially passaging SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in the presence of RDV. Using high throughput sequencing, we identified a single mutation in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NSP12) at a residue conserved among all coronaviruses in two independently evolved populations displaying decreased RDV sensitivity. Introduction of the NSP12 E802D mutation into our SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics backbone confirmed its role in decreasing RDV sensitivity in vitro. Substitution of E802 did not affect viral replication or activity of an alternate nucleoside analogue (EIDD2801) but did affect virus fitness in a competition assay. Analysis of the globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants (>800,000 sequences) showed no evidence of widespread transmission of RDV-resistant mutants. Surprisingly, we observed an excess of substitutions in spike at corresponding sites identified in the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (i.e., H69, E484, N501, H655) indicating that they can arise in vitro in the absence of immune selection. The identification and characterisation of a drug resistant signature within the SARS-CoV-2 genome has implications for clinical management and virus surveillance.\",\"Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum antiviral that has shown promise in treatment of influenza virus infections. While emergence of resistance has been observed for many antiinfluenza drugs, to date, clinical trials and laboratory studies of favipiravir have not yielded resistant viruses. Here we show evolution of resistance to favipiravir in the pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus in a laboratory setting. We found that two mutations were required for robust resistance to favipiravir. We demonstrate that a K229R mutation in motif F of the PB1 subunit of the influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) confers resistance to favipiravir in vitro and in cell culture. This mutation has a cost to viral fitness, but fitness can be restored by a P653L mutation in the PA subunit of the polymerase. K229R also conferred favipiravir resistance to RNA polymerases of other influenza A virus strains, and its location within a highly conserved structural feature of the RdRP suggests that other RNA viruses might also acquire resistance through mutations in motif F. The mutations identified here could be used to screen influenza virus-infected patients treated with favipiravir for the emergence of resistance.\",\"The error rate of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of RNA viruses is important in maintaining genetic diversity for viral adaptation and fitness. Numerous studies have shown that mutagen-resistant RNA virus variants display amino acid mutations in the RdRp and other replicase subunits, which in turn exhibit an altered fidelity phenotype affecting viral fitness, adaptability and pathogenicity. St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), like its close relative West Nile virus, is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has the ability to cause neuroinvasive disease in humans. Here, we describe the successful generation of multiple ribavirin-resistant populations containing a shared amino acid mutation in the SLEV RdRp (E416K). These E416K mutants also displayed resistance to the antiviral T-1106, an RNA mutagen similar to ribavirin. Structural modelling of the E416K polymerase mutation indicated its location in the pinky finger domain of the RdRp, distant from the active site. Deep sequencing of the E416K mutant revealed lower genetic diversity than wild-type SLEV after growth in both vertebrate and invertebrate cells. Phenotypic characterization showed that E416K mutants displayed similar or increased replication in mammalian cells, as well as modest attenuation in mosquito cells, consistent with previous work with West Nile virus high-fidelity variants. In addition, attenuation was limited to mosquito cells with a functional RNA interference response, suggesting an impaired capacity to escape RNA interference could contribute to attenuation of high-fidelity variants. Our results provide increased evidence that RNA mutagen resistance arises through modulation of the RdRp and give further insight into the consequences of altered fidelity of flaviviruses.\",\"RNA recombination is important in the formation of picornavirus species groups and the ongoing evolution of viruses within species groups. In this study, we examined the structure and function of poliovirus polymerase, 3D(pol), as it relates to RNA recombination. Recombination occurs when nascent RNA products exchange one viral RNA template for another during RNA replication. Because recombination is a natural aspect of picornavirus replication, we hypothesized that some features of 3D(pol) may exist, in part, to facilitate RNA recombination. Furthermore, we reasoned that alanine substitution mutations that disrupt 3D(pol)-RNA interactions within the polymerase elongation complex might increase and/or decrease the magnitudes of recombination. We found that an L420A mutation in 3D(pol) decreased the frequency of RNA recombination, whereas alanine substitutions at other sites in 3D(pol) increased the frequency of recombination. The 3D(pol) Leu420 side chain interacts with a ribose in the nascent RNA product 3 nucleotides from the active site of the polymerase. Notably, the L420A mutation that reduced recombination also rendered the virus more susceptible to inhibition by ribavirin, coincident with the accumulation of ribavirin-induced G\\u2192A and C\\u2192U mutations in viral RNA. We conclude that 3D(pol) Leu420 is critically important for RNA recombination and that RNA recombination contributes to ribavirin resistance.\",\"Enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) is a major causative pathogen of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) epidemics. No antiviral therapies are currently available for treating EV-A71 infections. Here, we selected five reported enterovirus inhibitors (suramin, itraconazole [ITZ], GW5074, rupintrivir, and favipiravir) with different mechanisms of action to test their abilities to inhibit EV-A71 replication alone and in combination. All selected compounds have anti-EV-A71 activities in cell culture. The combination of rupintrivir and ITZ or favipiravir was synergistic, while the combination of rupintrivir and suramin was additive. The combination of suramin and favipiravir exerted a strong synergistic antiviral effect. The observed synergy was not due to cytotoxicity, as there was no significant increase in cytotoxicity when compounds were used in combinations at the tested doses. To investigate the potential inhibitory mechanism of favipiravir against enterovirus, two favipiravir-resistant EV-A71 variants were independently selected, and both of them carried an S121N mutation in the finger subdomain of the 3D polymerase. Reverse engineering of this 3D S121N mutation into an infectious clone of EV-A71 confirmed the resistant phenotype. Moreover, viruses resistant to ITZ or favipiravir remained susceptible to other inhibitors. Most notably, combined with ITZ, rupintrivir prevented the development of ITZ-resistant variants. Taken together, these results provide a rational basis for the design of combination regimens for use in the treatment of EV-A71 infections.\",\"The quasispecies diversity of RNA viruses is mainly determined by the fidelity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during viral RNA replication. Certain amino acid residues play an important role in determining the fidelity, and such residues can be substituted with other amino acids to produce virus strains with higher fidelity. In this study, two amino acid substitutions (A283T and H421Y) in the RdRp of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were identified under the selection of ribavirin. Preliminary data showed that two substitutions were involved in conferring PRRSV with the properties of increased ribavirin resistance and restricted quasispecies diversity. The results indicated that these two amino acid residues (Ala283 and His421) play a crucial role in PRRSV replication by affecting the fidelity of its RdRp. The results have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism of PRRSV evolution and pathogenicity, and developing a safer modified live-attenuated vaccine (MLV) against PRRSV.\",\"Genetic diversity of influenza A viruses (IAV) acquired through the error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) or through genetic reassortment enables perpetuation of IAV in humans through epidemics or pandemics. Here, to assess the biological significance of genetic diversity acquired through RdRP, we characterize an IAV fidelity variant derived from passaging a seasonal H3N2 virus in the presence of ribavirin, a purine analogue that increases guanosine-to-adenosine mutations. We demonstrate that a single PB1-V43I mutation increases selectivity to guanosine in A/Wuhan/359/95 (H3N2) and A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) viruses. The H5N1 PB1-V43I-recombinant virus replicates to comparable titres as the wild-type virus in vitro or in the mouse lungs. However, a decrease in viral population diversity at day 3 post inoculation is associated with a tenfold reduced lethality and neurotropism in mice. Applying a fidelity variant with reduced mutational frequency, we provide direct experimental evidence for the role of genetic diversity in IAV pathogenesis.\",\"T-705, also known as favipiravir, is a small-molecule inhibitor that is currently in clinical development for the treatment of influenza virus infections. This molecule also inhibits the replication of a broad spectrum of other RNA viruses. The objective of this study was to investigate the antiviral effect of favipiravir on chikungunya virus (CHIKV) replication and to contribute to unravelling the molecular mechanism of action against this virus.\",\"In a screen for ribavirin resistance, a novel high-fidelity variant of human enterovirus 71 (EV71) with the single amino acid change L123F in its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp or 3D) was identified. Based on the crystal structure of EV71 RdRp, L123 locates at the entrance of the RNA template binding channel, which might form a fidelity checkpoint. EV71 RdRp-L123F variants generated less progeny in a guanidine resistance assay and virus populations with lower mutation frequencies in cell culture passage due to their higher replication fidelity. However, compared with wild-type viruses, they did not show growth defects. In vivo infections further revealed that high-fidelity mutations L123F and G64R (previously reported) negatively impacted EV71 fitness and greatly reduced viral pathogenicity alone or together in AG129 mice. Interestingly, a variant with double mutations, RG/B4-G64R/L123F (where RG/B4 is an EV71 genotype B4 virus constructed by reverse genetics [RG])showed higher fidelity in vitro and less virulence in vivo than any one of the above two single mutants. The 50% lethal dose (LD50) of the double mutant increased more than 500 times compared with the LD50 of wild-type RG/B4 in mice. The results indicated that these high-fidelity variants exhibited an attenuated pathogenic phenotype in vivo and offer promise as a live attenuated EV71 vaccine.\",\"Mutagenic nucleoside analogues can be used to isolate RNA virus high-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) variants, the majority of which are attenuated in vivo. However, attenuated foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) high-fidelity RdRp variants have not been isolated, and the correlations between RdRp fidelity and virulence remain unclear. Here, the mutagen ribavirin was used to select a ribavirin-resistant population of FMDV, and 4 amino acid substitutions (D5N, A38V, M194I, and M296V) were identified in the RdRp-coding region of the population. Through single or combined mutagenesis using a reverse genetics system, we generated direct experimental evidence that the rescued D5N, A38V, and DAMM mutants but not the M194I and M296V mutants are high-fidelity RdRp variants. Mutagen resistance assays revealed that the higher replication fidelity was associated with higher-level resistance to ribavirin. In addition, significantly attenuated fitness and virulence phenotypes were observed for the D5N, A38V, and DAMM mutants. Based on a systematic quantitative analysis of fidelity and virulence, we concluded that higher replication fidelity is associated with a more attenuated virus. These data suggest that the resulting restricted quasispecies diversity compromises the adaptability and virulence of an RNA virus population. The modulation of replication fidelity to attenuate virulence may represent a general strategy for the rational design of new types of live, attenuated vaccine strains.\",\"The influenza virus PB1 protein functions as a catalytic subunit of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and contains the highly conserved motifs of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases together with putative nucleotide-binding sites. PB1 also binds to viral genomic RNAs and its replicative intermediates through the promoter regions. The detail function and interplay between functional domains are not clarified although a part of structures and functions of PB1 have been clarified. In this study, we analyzed the function of PB1 subunit in the sense of nucleotide recognition using ribavirin, which is a nucleoside analog and inhibits viral RNA synthesis of many RNA viruses including influenza virus. We screened ribavirin-resistant PB1 mutants from randomly mutated PB1 cDNA library using a mini-replicon assay, and we identified a single mutation at the amino acid position 27 of PB1 as an important residue for the nucleotide recognition.\",\"In a screen for RNA mutagen-resistant foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) strains, we isolated an FMDV mutant with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) R84H substitution. This mutant, selected under the mutagenic pressure of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), is resistant not only to 5-FU but also to other two RNA mutagens, 5-azacytidine and ribavirin, suggesting that the RdRp R84H mutant is a high fidelity variant. Subsequently, the increased fidelity of this mutant was verified through analysis of mutation frequency, which revealed a 1.4-fold enhancement in RdRp fidelity compared with the wild-type virus. Further studies indicated that the R84H mutant exhibited slightly increased fitness in vitro, and its virulence was not reduced in suckling mice. These results indicated that an increase in RdRp fidelity does not always correlate with reduced virus fitness and virus attenuation. Thus, this isolated R84H mutant provides a new platform to examine the evolutionary dynamics of fidelity-changing RNA viruses, such as mutagen resistance, fitness and virulence.\",\"It has been shown in animal models that ribavirin-resistant poliovirus with a G64S mutation in its 3D polymerase has high replication fidelity coupled with attenuated virulence. Here, we describe the effects of mutagenesis in the human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) 3D polymerase on ribavirin resistance and replication fidelity. Seven substitutions were introduced at amino acid position 3D-G64 of a HEV71 full-length infectious cDNA clone (26M). Viable clone-derived virus populations were rescued from the G64N, G64R, and G64T mutant cDNA clones. The clone-derived G64R and G64T mutant virus populations were resistant to growth inhibition in the presence of 1,600 \\u03bcM ribavirin, whereas the growth of parental 26M and the G64N mutant viruses were inhibited in the presence of 800 \\u03bcM ribavirin. Nucleotide sequencing of the 2C and 3D coding regions revealed that the rate of random mutagenesis after 13 passages in the presence of 400 \\u03bcM ribavirin was nearly 10 times higher in the 26M genome than in the mutant G64R virus genome. Furthermore, random mutations acquired in the 2C coding regions of 26M and G64N conferred resistance to growth inhibition in the presence of 0.5 mM guanidine, whereas the G64R and G64T mutant virus populations remained susceptible to growth inhibition by 0.5 mM guanidine. Interestingly, a S264L mutation identified in the 3D coding region of 26M after ribavirin selection was also associated with both ribavirin-resistant and high replication fidelity phenotypes. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the 3D-G64R, 3D-G64T, and 3D-S264L mutations confer resistance upon HEV71 to the antiviral mutagen ribavirin, coupled with a high replication fidelity phenotype during growth in cell culture.\"],\"doi\":[\"10.1371/journal.ppat.1009929\",\"10.1073/pnas.1811345115\",\"10.1099/jgv.0.000682\",\"10.1128/JVI.00078-16\",\"10.1128/AAC.01073-16\",\"10.1099/jgv.0.000316\",\"10.1038/ncomms5794\",\"10.1093/jac/dku209\",\"10.1128/JVI.00289-14\",\"10.1128/JVI.03594-13\",\"10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.12.071\",\"10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.07.008\",\"10.1128/JVI.02139-12\"],\"index\":[35,229,384,443,449,539,676,702,743,758,771,822,905],\"key\":[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],\"processed_abstract\":[\"remdesivir

of HCV infection with peginterferon and ribavirin results in a low sustained virologic response rate, but has a number of undesirable adverse effects. Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) offer a high efficacy, low risk, and a short treatment time. However, the existence of resistance-associated mutations, particularly in the NS5B polymerase, can attenuate the efficacy of DAAs. The objective of this study was to identify amino acid changes in the NS5B gene linked to DAA resistance in treatment-naive Vietnamese chronic hepatitis C patients.\",\"The first Polish recommendations regarding the management of patients with COVID-19 were published by the Polish Society of Epidemiologists and Infectiologists (PTEiLChZ) on March 31, 2020, and the last annex was dated November 12, 2021. The ongoing state of pandemic, the emergence of new variants of the virus, and the availability of new drugs necessitate their updating. Changes introduced in the current version of recommendations for the management of COVID-19 comprised the possibility of using remedesivir in an outpatient setting, previously reserved for inpatient treatment, as well as other antiviral drugs-molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir / ritonavir. We revised the possibility of using monoclonal antibodies due to the resistance of the currently dominant Omicron variant. Anakinra, an antagonist of interleukin 1 receptors, has been added as a treatment option in advanced stages of the disease, and the recommended daily dose of glucocorticosteroids used in the most severe forms of COVID-19 has been increased. Information on vaccination and pre-exposure prophylaxis in specific populations has also been updated.\",\"The disease yellow fever was prevented by two live attenuated vaccines, strains 17D and French neurotropic vaccine (FNV), derived by serial passage of wild-type (WT) strains Asibi and French Viscerotropic virus (FVV), respectively. Both 17D and FNV displayed decreased genetic diversity and resistance to the antiviral Ribavirin compared to their WT parental strains, which are thought to contribute to their attenuated phenotypes. Subsequent studies found that only a few passages of WT strain FVV in HeLa cells resulted in an attenuated virus. In the current study, the genome sequence of FVV following five passages in HeLa cells (FVV HeLa p5) was determined through Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) with the aim to investigate the molecular basis of viral attenuation. It was found that WT FVV and FVV HeLa p5 virus differed by five amino acid substitutions: E-D155A, E-K331R, E-I412V, NS2A-T105A, and NS4B-V98I. Surprisingly, the genetic diversity and Ribavirin resistance of the FVV HeLa p5 virus were not statistically different to WT parent FVV. These findings suggest that while FVV HeLa p5 is attenuated, this is not dependent on a high-fidelity replication complex, characterized by reduced genetic diversity or increased Ribavirin stability, as seen with FNV and 17D vaccines.\",\"SARS-CoV-2 remdesivir resistance mutations have been generated in vitro but have not been reported in patients receiving treatment with the antiviral agent. We present a case of an immunocompromised patient with acquired B-cell deficiency who developed an indolent, protracted course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remdesivir therapy alleviated symptoms and produced a transient virologic response, but her course was complicated by recrudescence of high-grade viral shedding. Whole genome sequencing identified a mutation, E802D, in the nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which was not present in pre-treatment specimens. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the mutation conferred a ~6-fold increase in remdesivir IC50 but resulted in a fitness cost in the absence of remdesivir. Sustained clinical and virologic response was achieved after treatment with casirivimab-imdevimab. Although the fitness cost observed in vitro may limit the risk posed by E802D, this case illustrates the importance of monitoring for remdesivir resistance and the potential benefit of combinatorial therapies in immunocompromised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\",\"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important cause of viral hepatitis worldwide and there is currently no FDA-approved anti-HEV drug. The commonly used drug ribavirin (RBV) could not achieve viral clearance in all patients and can induce drug resistance. Recent studies showed sofosbuvir (SOF) can inhibit HEV replication in vitro and has add-on effect when combined with RBV, but the clinical effect of SOF against HEV infection remains controversial and the dosage of SOF warrants further exploration. In this study, a rabbit model for acute HEV infection was used to evaluate the effect of SOF at different doses against HEV genotype 3 and 4, and to compare the antiviral effect of SOF-plus-RBV therapy with RBV monotherapy. Virological parameters on fecal, serological and intrahepatic level were tested by real-time PCR and ELISA. Liver function tests and histopathological assays were performed. Both 200 mg/d and 300 mg/d SOF treatment inhibits HEV replication with relieved liver inflammation and declined levels of fecal HEV RNA and antigenemia. 300 mg/d SOF eliminated HEV replication while a short viral rebound was observed after 200 mg/d SOF treatment. The SOF-plus-RBV therapy also showed stronger anti-HEV effect than RBV monotherapy. Our study suggests that high dose of SOF showed anti-HEV effect in the rabbit model. Moreover, the de novo SOF-plus-RBV therapy which eliminated acute HEV infection more efficiently than RBV monotherapy may serve as an alternative treatment strategy but warrants further preclinical and clinical study.\",\"Hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection is a major clinical burden globally. Pegylated IFN-\\u03b1-2a (PEG-IFN-\\u03b1-2a) with ribavirin (RIB) therapy induces an array of cellular antiviral responses including dsRNA kinases (PKR), chemokines and cytokines to tackle the HCV infection. However, many HCV patients develop resistance to PEG-IFN/RIB therapy rendering the theray ineffective.\",\"The antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in COVID-19 hospitalized patients remains controversial.\",\"Combinations of direct-acting antivirals are needed to minimize drug resistance mutations and stably suppress replication of RNA viruses. Currently, there are limited therapeutic options against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and testing of a number of drug regimens has led to conflicting results. Here, we show that cobicistat, which is an FDA-approved drug booster that blocks the activity of the drug-metabolizing proteins cytochrome P450-3As (CYP3As) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Two independent cell-to-cell membrane fusion assays showed that the antiviral effect of cobicistat is exerted through inhibition of spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. In line with this, incubation with low-micromolar concentrations of cobicistat decreased viral replication in three different cell lines including cells of lung and gut origin. When cobicistat was used in combination with remdesivir, a synergistic effect on the inhibition of viral replication was observed in cell lines and in a primary human colon organoid. This was consistent with the effects of cobicistat on two of its known targets, CYP3A4 and P-gp, the silencing of which boosted the in vitro antiviral activity of remdesivir in a cobicistat-like manner. When administered in vivo to Syrian hamsters at a high dose, cobicistat decreased viral load and mitigated clinical progression. These data highlight cobicistat as a therapeutic candidate for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection and as a potential building block of combination therapies for COVID-19. IMPORTANCE The lack of effective antiviral treatments against SARS-CoV-2 is a significant limitation in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Single-drug regimens have so far yielded limited results, indicating that combinations of antivirals might be required, as previously seen for other RNA viruses. Our work introduces the drug booster cobicistat, which is approved by the FDA and typically used to potentiate the effect of anti-HIV protease inhibitors, as a candidate inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Beyond its direct activity as an antiviral, we show that cobicistat can enhance the effect of remdesivir, which was one of the first drugs proposed for treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the dual action of cobicistat as a direct antiviral and a drug booster can provide a new approach to design combination therapies and rescue the activity of compounds that are only partially effective in monotherapy.\",\"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten healthcare systems worldwide due to the limited access to vaccines, suboptimal treatment options, and the continuous emergence of new and more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. Reverse-genetics studies of viral genes and mutations have proven highly valuable in advancing basic virus research, leading to the development of therapeutics. We developed a functional and highly versatile full-length SARS-CoV-2 infectious system by cloning the sequence of a COVID-19 associated virus isolate (DK-AHH1) into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Viruses recovered after RNA-transfection of in vitro transcripts into Vero E6 cells showed growth kinetics and remdesivir susceptibility similar to the DK-AHH1 virus isolate. Insertion of reporter genes, green fluorescent protein, and nanoluciferase into the ORF7 genomic region led to high levels of reporter activity, which facilitated high throughput treatment experiments. We found that putative coronavirus remdesivir resistance-associated substitutions F480L and V570L-and naturally found polymorphisms A97V, P323L, and N491S, all in nsp12-did not decrease SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to remdesivir. A nanoluciferase reporter clone with deletion of spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins exhibited high levels of transient replication, was inhibited by remdesivir, and therefore could function as an efficient non-infectious subgenomic replicon system. The developed SARS-CoV-2 reverse-genetics systems, including recombinants to modify infectious viruses and non-infectious subgenomic replicons with autonomous genomic RNA replication, will permit high-throughput cell culture studies-providing fundamental understanding of basic biology of this coronavirus. We have proven the utility of the systems in rapidly introducing mutations in nsp12 and studying their effect on the efficacy of remdesivir, which is used worldwide for the treatment of COVID-19. Our system provides a platform to effectively test the antiviral activity of drugs and the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 mutants.\",\"Here, we report six cases of spontaneous pneumothorax and pneumomediastinitis in patients with COVID-19 in Iran, which were treated with different drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, sofosbuvir, atazanavir, and remdesivir as antiviral agents. Despite the differences in the type of drugs, pneumothorax occurred in all patients.\",\"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents an unmet clinical need, due to a high mortality rate, rapid mutation rate in the virus, increased chances of reinfection, lack of effectiveness of repurposed drugs and economic damage. COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for effective molecules. Clinically proven efficacy and safety profiles have made favipiravir (FVP) and remdesivir (RDV) promising therapeutic options for use against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Even though both are prodrug molecules with an antiviral role based on a similar mechanism of action, differences in pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and pharmacotoxicological mechanisms have been identified. The present study aims to provide a comprehensive comparative assessment of FVP and RDV against SARS-CoV-2 infections, by centralizing medical data provided by significant literature and authorized clinical trials, focusing on the importance of a better understanding of the interactions between drug molecules and infectious agents in order to improve the global management of COVID-19 patients and to reduce the risk of antiviral resistance.\",\"According to pivotal clinical trials, cure rates for sofosbuvir-based antiviral therapy exceed 96%. Treatment failure is usually assumed to be because of virological resistance-associated substitutions or clinical risk factors, yet the role of patient-specific genetic factors has not been well explored. We determined if patient-specific genetic factors help predict patients likely to fail sofosbuvir treatment in real-world treatment situations.\",\"A key element for the prevention and management of coronavirus disease 2019 is the development of effective therapeutics. Drug combination strategies offer several advantages over monotherapies. They have the potential to achieve greater efficacy, to increase the therapeutic index of drugs and to reduce the emergence of drug resistance. We assessed the in vitro synergistic interaction between remdesivir and ivermectin, both approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and demonstrated enhanced antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Whilst the in vitro synergistic activity reported here does not support the clinical application of this combination treatment strategy due to insufficient exposure of ivermectin in vivo, the data do warrant further investigation. Efforts to define the mechanisms underpinning the observed synergistic action could lead to the development of novel treatment strategies.\",\"Modified nucleosides show therapeutic promise for antiviral therapies. However, issues including the emergence of drug resistance, toxicity, and coinfections have posed new challenges for nucleoside-based antiviral drug discovery, particularly in the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Chemical manipulation could impact the antiviral potency, safety, and drug resistance of nucleosides. Generally, modified nucleosides are difficult to recognize by intracellular important enzymes as substrates and thus exhibit low toxicity. 4'-Modified nucleosides represent an important subclass of modified nucleosides for antiviral therapies. To prevent the occurrence of drug resistance, 4'-modified nucleosides should have 3'-OH, which should also be chemically unreactive for proviral DNA biosynthesis. The absence of 3'-OH may explain the occurrence of drug resistance for censavudine. The introduction of 4'-substituents improves enzymatic and acidic stability and makes the nucleosides more lipophilic, thus improving cell permeability and bioavailability. Steric hindrance between the 4'-substituent and 3'-OH changes the furanose conformation to the 3'-endo type, in which the oxygen lone pair on the furanose ring could not form an oxocarbonium ion for glycolysis. Currently, seven 4'-modified nucleoside drug candidates such as azvudine (also known as FNC), islatravir, censavudine, balapiravir, lumicitabine, AL-335, and 4-azidothymidine have progressed into clinical stages for treating viral infections. Of note, FNC was officially approved by NMPA in July 2021 for use in adult patients with high HIV-1 virus loads (nos. H20210035 and H20210036), providing an alternative therapeutic for patients with HIV-1. The long-term cellular retention of FNC suggests its potential as a long-lasting pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) agent for preventing HIV-1 infection. Mechanistically, FNC not only inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcription and replication but also restored A3G expression in peripheral blood CD4[+] T cells in HIV-1 patients receiving FNC. The 4'-azido group in azvudine stabilizes the 3'-C-endo (north) conformation by steric effects and the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the 3'-OH group, thus decreasing the nucleophilicity of 3'-OH. The north conformation may also enhance the phosphorylation efficiency of FNC by cellular kinases. Encouragingly, FNC, islatravir, and balapiravir show promise for the treatment of coronaviruses, of which FNC has advanced to phase 3 clinical trials in different countries to treat patients with COVID-19 (clinical trial numbers: NCT04668235 and NCT04425772). FNC cured the COVID-19 disease in almost all patients and showed better therapeutic efficacy than remdesivir. In this Account, we provide an overview of 4'-modified nucleoside analogs in clinical stages for antiviral therapies, highlighting the drug discovery strategies, structure-activity relationship studies, and preclinical/clinical studies and also give our perspectives on nucleoside-based antiviral drug discovery.\",\"Hepatotropic viruses naturally have narrow host and tissue tropisms, challenging the development of robust experimental models. The advent of organoid technology provides a unique opportunity for moving the field forward. Here, we demonstrate that three-dimensional cultured organoids from fetal and adult human liver with cholangiocyte or hepatocyte phenotype support hepatitis E virus (HEV) replication. Inoculation with infectious HEV particles demonstrates that human liver\\u2013derived organoids support the full life cycle of HEV infection. By directing organoids toward polarized monolayers in a transwell system, we observed predominantly apical secretion of HEV particles. Genome-wide transcriptomic and tRNAome analyses revealed robust host responses triggered by viral replication. Drug screening in organoids identified brequinar and homoharringtonine as potent HEV inhibitors, which are also effective against the ribavirin resistance variant harboring G1634R mutation. Thus, successful recapitulation of HEV infection in liver-derived organoids shall facilitate the study of virus-host interactions and development of antiviral therapies.\",\"Massive usage of antiviral compounds during a pandemic creates an ideal ground for emergence of resistant strains. Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), was extensively prescribed under emergency use authorization during the first 18 months of the COVID19 pandemic, before randomized controlled trials showed poor efficacy in hospitalized patients. RdRp mutations conferring resistance to remdesivir are well known from in vitro studies, and the huge SARS-CoV-2 sequencing effort during the ongoing COVID19 pandemic represents an unprecedented opportunity to assess emergence and fitness of antiviral resistance in vivo. We mined the GISAID database to extrapolate the frequency of remdesivir escape mutations. Our analysis reveals very low levels of remdesivir resistance worldwide despite massive usage.\",\"Circulation of avian influenza A viruses in poultry is a public health concern because these viruses may cause severe disease in humans and have the potential to become more transmissible among humans. Monitoring the susceptibility of these viruses to antivirals is important for influenza pandemic preparedness. However, information about their antiviral susceptibility is limited. Here, we determined the susceptibilities of avian influenza A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N8), A(H7N7), A(H7N9), A(H9N1), and A(H9N2) viruses isolated in Japan to the antivirals approved for use there: the M2 inhibitor amantadine; the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir; and the RNA polymerase inhibitors baloxavir and favipiravir. Genotypic methods that detect amino acid substitutions associated with antiviral resistance and phenotypic methods that assess viral susceptibility to drugs revealed that these avian influenza A viruses are susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors and RNA polymerase inhibitors. These results suggest that the neuraminidase inhibitors and the RNA polymerase inhibitors currently approved in Japan could be a treatment option against influenza A virus infections in humans.\",\"Since its discovery in 1989, the road to a cure for hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been slow, but most patients can now expect to achieve a sustained virological response (SVR). With direct-acting antiviral (DAA) combination therapies such as glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and velpatasvir/sofosbuvir, 98% of patients successfully eradicate the virus, even if previous treatments failed or if resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) are present. Adverse events are rare or mild, and patients with compensated cirrhosis and other co-morbidities are often eligible for treatment. However, a small number of patients fail to eradicate the virus even after retreatment. The cause of failure is mainly due to emergence of NS5A P32 deletion mutants after initial DAA therapy in genotype 1b patients, although the reason is unknown for some patients. Alternative therapies that do not rely on NS5A inhibitors, such as sofosbuvir plus ribavirin, can be attempted in these patients. While scaled-up treatment efforts present a challenge, another problem is that many carriers are unaware of their infection. Long-term damage to the liver becomes irreversible, and patients who are not diagnosed in time can develop liver cancer or liver failure even after eliminating the virus. The long-term costs of treatment of advanced liver disease in undiagnosed patients relative to the immediate costs of DAA therapy should be considered. As no vaccine is yet available, eventual elimination of the virus requires identifying and treating undiagnosed cases and screening of high-risk populations such as injection drug users and men who have sex with men and female sex workers.\",\"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global crisis. Clinical candidates with high efficacy, ready availability, and that do not develop resistance are in urgent need. Despite that screening to repurpose clinically approved drugs has provided a variety of hits shown to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture, there are few confirmed antiviral candidates in vivo. In this study, 94 compounds showing high antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells were identified from 2,580 FDA-approved small-molecule drugs. Among them, 24 compounds with low cytotoxicity were selected, and of these, 17 compounds also effectively suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection in HeLa cells transduced with human ACE2. Six compounds disturb multiple processes of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Their prophylactic efficacies were determined in vivo using Syrian hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seven compounds reduced weight loss and promoted weight regain of hamsters infected not only with the original strain but also the D614G variant. Except for cisatracurium, six compounds reduced hamster pulmonary viral load, and IL-6 and TNF-\\u03b1 mRNA when assayed at 4 d postinfection. In particular, sertraline, salinomycin, and gilteritinib showed similar protective effects as remdesivir in vivo and did not induce antiviral drug resistance after 10 serial passages of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, suggesting promising application for COVID-19 treatment.\",\"Frequent mumps outbreaks in vaccinated populations and the occurrence of neurological complications (e.g., aseptic meningitis or encephalitis) in patients with mumps indicate the need for the development of more efficient vaccines as well as specific antiviral therapies. RNA viruses are genetically highly heterogeneous populations that exist on the edge of an error threshold, such that additional increases in mutational burden can lead to extinction of the virus population. Deliberate modulation of their natural mutation rate is being exploited as an antiviral strategy and a possibility for rational vaccine design. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, to introduce mutations in the mumps virus (MuV) genome and to investigate if resistance develops during long-term in vitro exposure to ribavirin. An increase in MuV population heterogeneity in the presence of ribavirin has been observed after one passage in cell culture, as well as a bias toward C-to-U and G-to-A transitions, which have previously been defined as ribavirin-related. At higher ribavirin concentration, MuV loses its infectivity during serial passaging and does not recover. At low ribavirin concentration, serial passaging leads to a more significant increase in population diversity and a stronger bias towards ribavirin-related transitions, independently of viral strain or cell culture. In these conditions, the virus retains its initial growth capacity, without development of resistance at a whole-virus population level.\",\"Several clinical trials started during the COVID-19 pandemic to discover effective therapeutics led to identify a few candidates from the major clinical trials. However, in the past several months, quite a few SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged with significant mutations. Major mutations in the S-glycoprotein and other parts of the genome have led to the antibody's escape to small molecule-based therapeutic resistance. The mutations in S-glycoprotein trigger the antibody escape/resistance, and mutations in RdRp might cause remdesivir resistance. The article illustrates emerging mutations that have resulted in antibody escape to therapeutics resistance. In this direction, the article illustrates presently developed neutralizing antibodies (with their preclinical, clinical stages) and antibody escapes and associated mutations. Finally, owing to the RdRp mutations, the antiviral small molecules resistance is illustrated.\",\"SARS-CoV-2 remdesivir resistance mutations have been generated in vitro but have not been reported in patients receiving treatment with the antiviral agent. We present a case of an immunocompromised patient with acquired B-cell deficiency who developed an indolent, protracted course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remdesivir therapy alleviated symptoms and produced a transient virologic response, but her course was complicated by recrudescence of high-grade viral shedding. Whole genome sequencing identified a mutation, E802D, in the nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which was not present in pre-treatment specimens. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the mutation conferred a \\u223c6-fold increase in remdesivir IC50 but resulted in a fitness cost in the absence of remdesivir. Sustained clinical and virologic response was achieved after treatment with casirivimab-imdevimab. Although the fitness cost observed in vitro may limit the risk posed by E802D, this case illustrates the importance of monitoring for remdesivir resistance and the potential benefit of combinatorial therapies in immunocompromised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\",\"Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) mainly affects young children and immunocompromised patients, causing morbidity and mortality in a subset of patients. Since no specific treatment is available, this study aims to explore the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents including favipiravir and remdesivir for treating HCoV-NL63 infection. We first successfully modelled the 3D structure of HCoV-NL63 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) based on the experimentally solved SARS-CoV-2 RdRp structure. Molecular docking indicated that favipiravir has similar binding affinities to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 RdRp with LibDock scores of 75 and 74, respectively. The LibDock scores of remdesivir to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 were 135 and 151, suggesting that remdesivir may have a higher affinity to HCoV-NL63 compared to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. In cell culture models infected with HCoV-NL63, both favipiravir and remdesivir significantly inhibited viral replication and production of infectious viruses. Overall, remdesivir compared to favipiravir is more potent in inhibiting HCoV-NL63 in cell culture. Importantly, there is no evidence of resistance development upon long-term exposure to remdesivir. Furthermore, combining favipiravir or remdesivir with the clinically used antiviral cytokine interferon-alpha resulted in synergistic effects. These findings provided a proof-of-concept that anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, in particular remdesivir, have the potential to be repurposed for treating HCoV-NL63 infection.\",\"The emergence of fast-spreading SARS-CoV-2 mutants has sparked a new phase of COVID-19 pandemic. There is a dire necessity for antivirals targeting highly conserved genomic domains on SARS-CoV-2 that are less prone to mutation. The nsp12, also known as the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), the core component of 'SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex', is a potential well-conserved druggable antiviral target. Several FDA-approved RdRp 'nucleotide analog inhibitors (NAIs)' such as remdesivir, have been repurposed to treat COVID-19 infections. The NAIs target RdRp protein translation and competitively block the nucleotide insertion into the RNA chain, resulting in the inhibition of viral replication. However, the replication proofreading function of nsp14-ExoN could provide resistance to SARS-CoV-2 against many NAIs. Conversely, the 'non-nucleoside analog inhibitors (NNAIs)' bind to allosteric sites on viral polymerase surface, change the redox state; thereby, exert antiviral activity by altering interactions between the enzyme substrate and active core catalytic site of the RdRp. NNAIs neither require metabolic activation (unlike NAIs) nor compete with intracellular pool of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) for anti-RdRp activity. The NNAIs from phytonutrient origin are potential antiviral candidates compared to their synthetic counterparts. Several in-silico studies reported the antiviral spectrum of natural phytonutrient-NNAIs such as Suramin, Silibinin (flavonolignan), Theaflavin (tea polyphenol), Baicalein (5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone), Corilagin (gallotannin), Hesperidin (citrus bioflavonoid), Lycorine (pyrrolidine alkaloid), with superior redox characteristics (free binding energy, hydrogen-bonds, etc.) than antiviral drugs (i.e. remdesivir, favipiravir). These phytonutrient-NNAIs also exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory and cardioprotective functions, with multifunctional therapeutic benefits in the clinical management of COVID-19.\",\"Considering the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need to develop effective treatments. At present, neutralizing antibodies and small-molecule drugs such as remdesivir, the most promising compound to treat this infection, have attracted considerable attention. However, some potential problems need to be concerned including viral resistance to antibody-mediated neutralization caused by selective pressure from a single antibody treatment, the unexpected antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect, and the toxic effect of small-molecule drugs.\",\"The genomic reshuffling, mutagenicity, and high transmission rate of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen highlights an urgent need for effective antiviral interventions for COVID-19 control. Targeting the highly conserved viral genes and/or gene-encoded viral proteins such as main proteinase (M[pro]), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicases are plausible antiviral approaches to prevent replication and propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are prone to extensive mutagenesis; however, any genetic alteration to its highly conserved M[pro] enzyme is often detrimental to the viral pathogen. Therefore, inhibitors that target the M[pro] enzyme could reduce the risk of mutation-mediated drug resistance and provide effective antiviral protection. Several existing antiviral drugs and dietary bioactives are currently repurposed to treat COVID-19. Dietary bioactives from three ayurvedic medicinal herbs, 18 \\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid (\\u0394G = 8.86 kcal/mol), Solanocapsine (\\u0394G = 8.59 kcal/mol), and Vasicoline (\\u0394G = 7.34 kcal/mol), showed high-affinity binding to M[pro] enzyme than the native N3 inhibitor (\\u0394G = 5.41 kcal/mol). Flavonoids strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 M[pro] with comparable or higher potency than the antiviral drug, remdesivir. Several tannin hydrolysates avidly bound to the receptor-binding domain and catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) of SARS-CoV-2 M[pro] through H-bonding forces. Quercetin binding to M[pro] altered the thermostability of the viral protein through redox-based mechanism and inhibited the viral enzymatic activity. Interaction of quercetin-derivatives with the M[pro] seem to be influenced by the 7-OH group and the acetoxylation of sugar moiety on the ligand molecule. Based on pharmacokinetic and ADMET profiles, several phytonutrients could serve as a promising redox nutraceutical for COVID-19 management.\",\"Influenza A virus, the main flu agent, affects billions of people worldwide. Conventional treatments still present limitations related to drug-resistance and severe side effects. As a result, natural product-derived molecules have been increasingly investigated as prospect drug candidates. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the possible anti-flu activity and to evaluate the toxicity and pharmacokinetic parameters, by in silico approaches, of the Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. phytochemical compounds. Nine phytocompounds and six antiviral drugs (Amantadine, Umifenovir, Favipiravir, Nitazoxanide, Oseltamivir, Zanamivir) were selected for the analyses against four Influenza A proteins: neuraminidase, polymerase basic protein 2, hemagglutinin and M2 ion channel protein. The molecular docking, the predicted antiviral activity, the predicted toxicity and the pharmacokinetics investigations were conducted. The obtained results demonstrated that Syringaresinol and Cycloartenone display promising in silico antiviral activity (binding energy < 5.0 and \\u2265 9.0 kcal/mol) and safety (low toxicity than commercial anti-flu drugs). Overall, this study corroborated the hypothesis that S. brasiliensis barks extract has a biological activity against Influenza A virus. Additionally, Syringaresinol and Cycloartenone have multiple targets in Influenza A virus and showed themselves as the most promising phytocompounds to be isolated and considered for the therapeutic arsenal against the flu.\",\"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite intensive and global efforts to discover and develop novel antiviral therapies, only Remdesivir has been approved as a treatment for COVID-19. Therefore, effective antiviral therapeutics are still urgently needed to combat and halt the pandemic. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates high potential as a reliable target for the development of antivirals. We previously developed a cell-based assay to assess the efficiency of compounds that target SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, as well as their tolerance to viral exoribonuclease-mediated proof-reading. In our previous study, we discovered that 2-((1H-indol-3-yl)thio)-N-phenyl-acetamides specifically targets the RdRp of both respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus. Thus, we hypothesize that 2-((1H-indol-3-yl)thio)-N-phenyl-acetamides may also have the ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by targeting its RdRp activity. In this research, we test a compound library containing 103 of 2-((1H-indol-3-yl)thio)-N-phenyl-acetamides against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, using our cell-based assay. Among these compounds, the top five candidates strongly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RdRp activity while exhibiting low cytotoxicity and resistance to viral exoribonuclease. Compound 6-72-2a is the most promising candidate with the lowest EC50 value of 1.41 \\u03bcM and highest selectivity index (CC50/EC50) (above 70.92). Furthermore, our data suggests that 4-46b and 6-72-2a also inhibit the replication of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 virus in a dose-dependent manner. Compounds 4-46b and 6-72-2a exhibit EC50 values of 1.13 \\u03bcM and 0.94 \\u03bcM, respectively, on HCoV-OC43 viral replication. However, higher concentrations of these compounds are needed to effectively block HCoV-NL63 replication. Together, our findings successfully identified 4-46b and 6-72-2a as promising inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.\",\"Plant elicitors are a class of plant protection agents that can stimulate plant immunity against phytopathogen without a potential resistance problem. In searching for novel plant elicitor candidates, a series of novel N-(2-phenyl-3-pyridyl) thiadiazole/isothiazole carboxamide analogs were designed and synthesized.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was first discovered in 1989, and patients infected with HCV were initially treated with interferon (IFN) monotherapy. In the 2000s, pegylated IFN combined with ribavirin was the mainstay of therapy for infected patients, but the sustained virologic response (SVR) rate was less than 50% for patients with HCV genotype 1. To further improve the therapeutic effect, direct-acting antiviral (DAA) was developed, and combination therapy with DAA and IFN has been available since 2011. In addition, IFN-free DAA therapy became available in 2014, and SVR was achieved in more than 95% of patients with chronic hepatitis and compensated cirrhosis. Thus, in just 30 years since the discovery of HCV, we aim to eliminate HCV in almost all patients. However, there are remaining issues to be addressed. Many of the patients who achieved SVR with DAA therapy had advanced liver fibrosis, and it is necessary to verify to what extent DAA therapy improves their prognosis in terms of liver function, hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence, and mortality. Resistance-associated substitutions can cause failure of DAA therapy, and the search for an effective therapy for high-level resistant viruses such as P32 deletion is particularly important. DAA therapy was approved for use in patients with decompensated cirrhosis in Japan in 2019, which is an unmet need so far. It is also important to verify the efficacy and safety in real-world settings. The World Health Organization aims to eliminate HCV by 2030, and Japan must tackle its remaining issues to achieve this goal.\",\"This study aimed to assess the correlation between the genotyping of interleukin-10 (IL-10 polymorphism rs 1800871) and the incidence hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) treated with direct acting antivirals (DAAs).\",\"The therapeutic targeting of the nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) with nucleotide analogs led to a deep understanding of this enzymes structure, function and substrate specificity. Unlike previously studied DNA polymerases including the reverse transcriptase of Human Immunodeficiency Virus, development of biochemical assays for HCV RdRp proved challenging due to low solubility of the full-length protein and inefficient acceptance of exogenous primer/templates. Despite the poor apparent specific activity, HCV RdRp was found to support rapid and processive transcription once elongation is initiated in vitro consistent with its high level of viral replication in the livers of patients. Understanding of the substrate specificity of HCV RdRp led to the discovery of the active triphosphate of sofosbuvir as a nonobligate chain-terminator of viral RNA transcripts. The ternary crystal structure of HCV RdRp, primer/template, and incoming nucleotide showed the interaction between the nucleotide analog and the 2'-hydroxyl binding pocket and how an unfit mutation of serine 282 to threonine results in resistance by interacting with the uracil base and modified 2'-position of the analog. Host polymerases mediate off-target toxicity of nucleotide analogs and the active metabolite of sofosbuvir was found to not be efficiently incorporated by host polymerases including the mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT). Knowledge from studying inhibitors of HCV RdRp serves to advance antiviral drug discovery for other emerging RNA viruses including the discovery of remdesivir as an inhibitor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), the virus that causes COVID-19.\",\"A massive vaccination campaign against the global COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus began worldwide in January 2021. However, studies continue to investigate the most effective and safe drug therapies to manage the various stages of viral infection. It is critical in the therapeutic management of the patient, with ongoing COVID-19 infection, to reduce viral load and replication, and to regulate the generalized hyperinflammatory state caused by the cytokine storm that occurs in the most severe phases. Probably the right drug therapy is represented by the use of different drugs acting in different modalities and on different targets, to avoid also viral drug resistance. In this article, we describe an interesting scientific pharmacological hypothesis arising from the evidence in the literature; we believe that the association of baricitinib/remdesivir/rhACE2, administered at the right time and dose, represents an important pharmacological synergism that can be therapeutically more effective for the treatment of COVID-19 infection than the single administration of drugs and avoid the phenomenon of drug resistance caused by the virus.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease, as it holds a significant role in developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Combination therapy with Pegaferon and Ribavirin leads to viral clearance of only 50% of patients. During the host antiviral response, protein kinase R (PKR) interacts with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2\\u03b1), that leads to the inhibition of viral protein synthesis. The viral NS5A protein appears to interfere with this antiviral action, evading the host immune response. However, mutations in the NS5A gene have been observed to render HCV more susceptible to treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the mutations present in the IFN Sensitivity Determining Region (ISDR) and NS5A-PKRbinding domain regions in chronic HCV infected patients before and after therapy.\",\"The antiviral efficacy of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial. We aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of remdesivir plus standard of care compared with standard of care alone in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, with indication of oxygen or ventilator support.\",\"The unprecedented 2013-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak accelerated several medical countermeasures (MCMs) against Ebola virus disease (EVD). Several investigational products (IPs) were used throughout the outbreak but were not conclusive for efficacy results. Only the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) on ZMapp was promising but inconclusive. More recently, during the second-largest Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), four IPs, including one small molecule (Remdesivir), two monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktails (ZMapp and REGN-EB3) and a single mAb (mAb114), were evaluated in an RCT, the Pamoja Tulinde Maisha (PALM) study. Two products (REGN-EB3 and mAb114) demonstrated efficacy as compared to the control arm, ZMapp. There were remarkably few side effects recorded in the trial. The FDA approved both medications in this scientifically sound study, marking a watershed moment in the field of EVD therapy. These products can be produced relatively inexpensively and can be stockpiled. The administration of mAbs in EVD patients appears to be safe and effective, while several critical knowledge gaps remain; the impact of early administration of Ebola-specific mAbs on developing a robust immune response for future Ebola virus exposure is unknown. The viral mutation escape, leading to resistance, presents a potential limitation for single mAb therapy; further improvements need to be explored. Understanding the contribution of Fc-mediated antibody functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of those approved mAbs is still critical. The potential merit of combination therapy and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) need to be demonstrated. Furthermore, the PALM trial has accounted for 30% of mortality despite the administration of specific treatments. The putative role of EBOV soluble Glycoprotein (sGP) as a decoy to the immune system, the virus persistence, and relapses might be investigated for treatment failure. The development of pan-filovirus or pan-species mAbs remains essential for protection. The interaction between FDA-approved mAbs and vaccines remains unclear and needs to be investigated. In this review, we summarize the efficacy and safety results of the PALM study and review current research questions for the further development of mAbs in pre-exposure or emergency post-exposure use.\",\"Transporters in the human liver play a major role in the clearance of endo- and xenobiotics. Apical (canalicular) transporters extrude compounds to the bile, while basolateral hepatocyte transporters promote the uptake of, or expel, various compounds from/into the venous blood stream. In the present work we have examined the in vitro interactions of some key repurposed drugs advocated to treat COVID-19 (lopinavir, ritonavir, ivermectin, remdesivir and favipiravir), with the key drug transporters of hepatocytes. These transporters included ABCB11/BSEP, ABCC2/MRP2, and SLC47A1/MATE1 in the canalicular membrane, as well as ABCC3/MRP3, ABCC4/MRP4, SLC22A1/OCT1, SLCO1B1/OATP1B1, SLCO1B3/OATP1B3, and SLC10A1/NTCP, residing in the basolateral membrane. Lopinavir and ritonavir in low micromolar concentrations inhibited BSEP and MATE1 exporters, as well as OATP1B1/1B3 uptake transporters. Ritonavir had a similar inhibitory pattern, also inhibiting OCT1. Remdesivir strongly inhibited MRP4, OATP1B1/1B3, MATE1 and OCT1. Favipiravir had no significant effect on any of these transporters. Since both general drug metabolism and drug-induced liver toxicity are strongly dependent on the functioning of these transporters, the various interactions reported here may have important clinical relevance in the drug treatment of this viral disease and the existing co-morbidities.\",\"The antiviral remdesivir has been approved by regulatory bodies such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug administration (FDA) for the treatment of COVID-19. However, its efficacy is debated and toxicity concerns might limit the therapeutic range of this drug. Computational models that aid in balancing efficacy and toxicity would be of great help. Parametrizing models is difficult because the prodrug remdesivir is metabolized to its active form (RDV-TP) upon cell entry, which complicates dose-activity relationships. Here, we employ a computational model that allows drug efficacy predictions based on the binding affinity of RDV-TP for its target polymerase in SARS-CoV-2. We identify an optimal infusion rate to maximize remdesivir efficacy. We also assess drug efficacy in suppressing both wild-type and resistant strains, and thereby describe a drug regimen that may select for resistance. Our results differ from predictions using prodrug dose-response curves (pseudo-EC50s). We expect that reaching 90% inhibition (EC90) is insufficient to suppress SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs. While standard dosing mildly inhibits viral polymerase and therefore likely reduces morbidity, we also expect selection for resistant mutants for most realistic parameter ranges. To increase efficacy and safeguard against resistance, we recommend more clinical trials with dosing regimens that substantially increase the levels of RDV-TP and/or pair remdesivir with companion antivirals.\",\"With the increasing severity of plant diseases and the emergence of pathogen resistance, there is an urgent need for the development of new efficient and environment-friendly pesticides. Marine natural product (MNP) resources are rich and diverse. Structural simplification based on MNPs is an important strategy to find novel pesticide candidates. In this work, the marine natural product 6\\u2033-debromohamacanthin A (1a) was efficiently prepared and selected as the parent structure. A series of hamacanthin derivatives were designed, synthesized, and studied on the antiviral and antifungal activities. Most of these compounds displayed higher antiviral activities than ribavirin. The antiviral activities of compounds 1a and 13e-13h are similar to or higher than that of ningnanmycin (perhaps the most efficient anti-plant-virus agent). Compound 13h was selected for further antiviral mechanism research via transmission electron microscopy, molecular docking, and fluorescence titration. The results showed that compound 13h could bind to TMV CP and interfere with the assembly process of TMV CP and RNA. In addition, these hamacanthin derivatives also exhibited broad-spectrum inhibitory effects against eight common agricultural pathogens. Compounds 1a, 12b, and 12f with excellent fungicidal activities can be considered as new fungicidal candidates for further research. These results provide a basis for the application of hamacanthin alkaloids in crop protection.\",\"Detailed information on intrahost viral evolution in SARS-CoV-2 with and without treatment is limited. Sequential viral loads and deep sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from the upper respiratory tract of nine hospitalized children, three of whom were treated with remdesivir, revealed that remdesivir treatment suppressed viral load in one patient but not in a second infected with an identical strain without any evidence of drug resistance found. Reduced levels of subgenomic RNA during treatment of the second patient, suggest an additional effect of remdesivir on viral replication. Haplotype reconstruction uncovered persistent SARS-CoV-2 variant genotypes in four patients. These likely arose from within-host evolution, although superinfection cannot be excluded in one case. Although our dataset is small, observed sample-to-sample heterogeneity in variant frequencies across four of nine patients suggests the presence of discrete viral populations in the lung with incomplete population sampling in diagnostic swabs. Such compartmentalization could compromise the penetration of remdesivir into the lung, limiting the drugs in vivo efficacy, as has been observed in other lung infections.\",\"Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) currently being used to manage COVID-19. Accumulation of mutations in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RdRp may facilitate antigenic drift, generating favipiravir resistance. Focussing on the chain-termination mechanism utilized by favipiravir, we used high-throughput interface-based protein design to generate > 100 000 designs of the favipiravir-binding site of RdRp and identify mutational hotspots. We identified several single-point mutants and designs having a sequence identity of 97%-98% with wild-type RdRp, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can develop favipiravir resistance with few mutations. Out of 134 mutations documented in the CoV-GLUE database, 63 specific mutations were already predicted as resistant in our calculations, thus attaining \\u02dc 47% correlation with the sequencing data. These findings improve our understanding of the potential signatures of adaptation in SARS-CoV-2 against favipiravir.\",\"Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified the need for a better understanding of which patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be cured with ultrashort course HCV therapy. Methods: A total of 202 individuals with chronic HCV were randomised to fixed-duration shortened therapy (8 weeks) vs variable-duration ultrashort strategies (VUS1/2). Participants not cured following first-line treatment were retreated with 12 weeks' sofosbuvir/ledipasvir/ribavirin. The primary outcome was sustained virological response 12 weeks (SVR12) after first-line treatment and retreatment. Participants were factorially randomised to receive ribavirin with first-line treatment. Results: All evaluable participants achieved SVR12 overall (197/197, 100% [95% CI 98-100]) demonstrating non-inferiority between fixed-duration and variable-duration strategies (difference 0% [95% CI -3.8%, +3.7%], 4% pre-specified non-inferiority margin). First-line SVR12 was 91% [86%-97%] (92/101) for fixed-duration vs 48% [39%-57%] (47/98) for variable-duration, but was significantly higher for VUS2 (72% [56%-87%] (23/32)) than VUS1 (36% [25%-48%] (24/66)). Overall, first-line SVR12 was 72% [65%-78%] (70/101) without ribavirin and 68% [61%-76%] (69/98) with ribavirin (p=0.48). At treatment failure, the emergence of viral resistance was lower with ribavirin (12% [2%-30%] (3/26)) than without (38% [21%-58%] (11/29), p=0.01). Conclusions: Unsuccessful first-line short-course therapy did not compromise retreatment with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir/ribavirin (100% SVR12). SVR12 rates were significantly increased when ultrashort treatment varied between 4-7 weeks rather than 4-6 weeks. Ribavirin significantly reduced resistance emergence in those failing first-line therapy. ISRCTN Registration: 37915093 (11/04/2016).\",\"Members of the genus Ebolavirus cause lethal disease in humans, with Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) being the most pathogenic (up to 90% morality) and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV) the least pathogenic (\\u223c37% mortality). Historically, there has been a lack of research on BDBV, and there is no means to study BDBV outside of a high-containment laboratory. Here, we describe a minigenome replication system to study BDBV transcription and compare the efficacy of small-molecule inhibitors between EBOV and BDBV. Using this system, we examined the ability of the polymerase complex proteins from EBOV and BDBV to interact and form a functional unit as well as the impact of the genomic untranslated ends, known to contain important signals for transcription (3'-untranslated region) and replication (5'-untranslated region). Various levels of compatibility were observed between proteins of the polymerase complex from each ebolavirus, resulting in differences in genome transcription efficiency. Most pronounced was the effect of the nucleoprotein and the 3'-untranslated region. These data suggest that there are intrinsic specificities in the polymerase complex and untranslated signaling regions that could offer insight regarding observed pathogenic differences. Further adding to the differences in the polymerase complexes, posttransfection/infection treatment with the compound remdesivir (GS-5734) showed a greater inhibitory effect against BDBV than EBOV. The delayed growth kinetics of BDBV and the greater susceptibility to polymerase inhibitors indicate that disruption of the polymerase complex is a viable target for therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Ebolavirus disease is a viral infection and is fatal in 25 to 90% of cases, depending on the viral species and the amount of supportive care available. Two species have caused outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV). Pathogenesis and clinical outcome differ between these two species, but there is still limited information regarding the viral mechanism for these differences. Previous studies suggested that BDBV replicates slower than EBOV, but it is unknown if this is due to differences in the polymerase complex and its role in transcription and replication. This study details the construction of a minigenome replication system that can be used in a biosafety level 2 laboratory. This system will be important for studying the polymerase complex of BDBV and comparing it with other filoviruses and can be used as a tool for screening inhibitors of viral growth.\",\"At present, global vaccination for the SARS-CoV2 virus 2019 (COVID-19) is 95% effective. Generally, viral infections are arduous to cure due to the mutating nature of viral genomes, with the consequent quick development of resistance, posing significant fatalities or hazards. The novel corona viral strains are increasingly lethal than earlier variants, as those evolve faster than imagined. Despite the emergence of several present innovative treatment options, the vaccines, and available drugs, the latter still are the needs of the time. Therefore, repurposing the approved pharmaceutical drugs of a well-known safety profile would be ascertained to provide faster antiviral approaches for the newer strains of COVID-19. Recently, a combination of remdesivir, which has a competitively inhibitory effect on the nucleotide uptake in the virus, and the merimepodibs, an inhibitor of the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which has a role in the synthesis of nucleotides of guanine bases, is in use in phase 2 clinical trials. However, new investigations suggest that using remdesivir, there is no statistically significant difference with uncertain clinical importance for moderate COVID-19 patients. Herein, an intellectual selection of approved drugs based on the safety profile is described, to target any essential enzymes that are required for the virus-receptor contact, fusion, and/or different stages of the life cycle of this virus, should help to screen drugs against newer strains of COVID-19.Graphical abstract.\",\"During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the identification of effective antiviral drugs is crucial. Unfortunately, no specific treatment or vaccine is available to date.\",\"Antiviral drugs (AvDs) are the primary resource in the global battle against viruses, including the recent fight against corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most AvDs require multiple medications, and their use frequently leads to drug resistance, since they have poor oral bioavailability and low efficacy due to their low solubility/low permeability. Characterizing the in vivo metabolism and pharmacokinetic characteristics of AvDs may help to solve the problems associated with AvDs and enhance their efficacy. In this review of AvDs, we systematically investigated their structure-based metabolic reactions and related enzymes, their cellular pharmacology, and the effects of metabolism on AvD pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. We further assessed how delivery systems achieve better metabolism and pharmacology of AvDs. This review suggests that suitable nanosystems may help to achieve better pharmacological activity and pharmacokinetic behavior of AvDs by altering drug metabolism through the utilization of advanced nanotechnology and appropriate administration routes. Notably, such AvDs as ribavirin, remdesivir, favipiravir, chloroquine, lopinavir and ritonavir have been confirmed to bind to the severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) receptor and thus may represent anti-COVID-19 treatments. Elucidating the metabolic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of AvDs may help pharmacologists to identify new formulations with high bioavailability and efficacy and help physicians to better treat virus-related diseases, including COVID-19.\",\"During chronic viral infections, CD8 T cells rapidly lose antiviral and immune-stimulatory functions in a sustained program termed exhaustion. In addition to this loss of function, CD8 T cells with the highest affinity for viral antigen can be physically deleted. Consequently, treatments designed to restore function to exhausted cells and control chronic viral replication are limited from the onset by the decreased breadth of the antiviral T cell response. Yet, it remains unclear why certain populations of CD8 T cells are deleted while others are preserved in an exhausted state. We report that CD8 T cell deletion during chronic viral infection can be prevented by therapeutically lowering viral replication early after infection. The initial resistance to deletion enabled long-term maintenance of antiviral cytolytic activity of the otherwise deleted high-affinity CD8 T cells. In combination with decreased virus titers, CD4 T cell help and prolonged interactions with costimulatory molecules B7-1/B7-2 were required to prevent CD8 T cell deletion. Thus, therapeutic strategies to decrease early virus replication could enhance virus-specific CD8 T cell diversity and function during chronic infection.\",\"Several clinical studies have reported the efficacy of favipiravir in reducing viral load and shortening the duration of symptoms. However, the viability of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of favipiravir therapy and the potential for resistance development is unclear.\",\"Due to complex interplay between host and viral factors, pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is considered a challenging issue. Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is not confined only to liver but can induce disturbances in many other organs and systems. Our primary aim for this study was to evaluate biological response rates and sustained virological response (SVR) in patients diagnosed with CHC, treated with Interferon-alpha (IFN-\\u03b1), Pegylated (PEG)-IFN-\\u03b12a or -\\u03b12b plus Ribavirin. The second aim of the study was the identification of predictive factors for a favorable response to antiviral therapy in patients diagnosed with CHC. We enrolled in this study 210 patients diagnosed with CHC who have accomplished all inclusion and exclusion criteria, treated with PEG-IFN plus Ribavirin. Patients' recovery progress has been evaluated by determining: age, gender; biochemical tests: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST); serological assays - detect anti-HCV antibody and molecular assays - detect, quantify and/or characterize hepatitis C viral load (ribonucleic acid) (HCV-RNA); liver histopathological (HP) examination. According to their response to treatment, they were classified into responders (n=145) and non-responders (n=65). Liver biopsies were histopathologically evaluated for necroinflammatory grade and fibrosis stage according to the modified Ishak and Metavir scoring systems for chronic hepatitis. Demographic, laboratory, and HP results were introduced in statistical analysis. These parameters were included in area under curve (AUC) analysis in order to estimate their degree of influence on getting early virological response (EVR) and SVR. Our study demonstrates that factors connected to treatment failure in CHC are linked to older age, high hepatitis C viral load, and impaired glucose tolerance at beginning of treatment [high fasting glucose and insulin, high homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index] and also to liver histology features (high fibrosis score, liver steatosis, iron infiltration, and more or less high necroinflammatory activity). Analyzing results of our study shows that HOMA-IR index, serum insulin levels, baseline HCV-RNA, baseline mean blood glucose and HP score like Ishak fibrosis score, steatosis score and liver iron score may have a predictive value for obtaining an EVR in patients diagnosed with CHC.\",\"The abuse of ribavirin, an antiviral drug, in poultry breeding can cause quality degradation and drug resistance. So it is of great importance to establish a simple and effective method for detecting ribavirin in foods. In this work, aptamers that could especially bind to ribavirin with high affinity were obtained by the Capture-SELEX method. After 15 rounds of enrichment, ssDNA library pool was enriched and then analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. The seven most enriched sequences were selected as candidate aptamers for affinity and specificity characterization. Among the candidate aptamers, APT-1 was proved to be the optimal aptamer. The dissociation constant (Kd) values of APT-1 obtained by the two methods of colorimetric and fluorescence were 34.34 \\u00b1 6.038 nmol L[-1], 61.19 \\u00b1 21.48 nmol L[-1], respectively. To study the binding mechanism of the selected aptamer, molecular docking was conducted and results indicated that hydrogen bonds were formed at binding sites located at G37, T38, A40, T53 and A54. Furthermore, to confirm the practicability of the selected aptamer, a fluorescence assay was designed, showing the liner range within 1.0-50 ng mL[-1] and the low detection limit of 0.67 ng mL[-1]. Besides, the aptamer was applied for the detection of ribavirin in chicken samples and the recoveries ranged from 87.26% to 105.57%, which showed great application potential in food safety.\",\"Shortening the treatment duration for chronic hepatitis C may increase feasibility and reduce the cost of cure. The aims of this study were to compare 4 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) treatment with and without ribavirin for patients with chronic hepatitis C and favourable baseline characteristics and to monitor the development of resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) and re-treatment outcomes if treatment failed.\",\"Interactive networks of transcription factors (TFs) have critical roles in epigenetic and gene regulation for cancer progression. It is required to clarify underlying mechanisms for transcriptional activation through concerted efforts of TFs. Here, we show the essential role of disease phase-specific TF collaboration changes in advanced prostate cancer (PC). Investigation of the transcriptome in castration-resistant PC (CRPC) revealed OCT4 as a key TF in the disease pathology. OCT4 confers epigenetic changes by promoting complex formation with FOXA1 and androgen receptor (AR), the central signals for the progression to CRPC. Meanwhile, OCT4 facilitates a distinctive complex formation with nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) to gain chemo-resistance in the absence of AR. Mechanistically, we reveal that OCT4 increases large droplet formations with AR/FOXA1 as well as NRF1 in vitro. Disruption of TF collaborations using a nucleoside analogue, ribavirin, inhibited treatment-resistant PC tumor growth. Thus, our findings highlight the formation of TF collaborations as a potent therapeutic target in advanced cancer.\",\"A variety of antiviral treatments for COVID-19 have been investigated, involving many repurposed drugs. Currently, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, encoded by nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) has been targeted by numerous inhibitors, e.g., remdesivir, the only provisionally approved treatment to-date, although the clinical impact of these interventions remains inconclusive. However, the potential emergence of antiviral resistance poses a threat to the efficacy of any successful therapies on a wide scale. Here, we propose a framework to monitor the emergence of antiviral resistance, and as a proof of concept, we address the interaction between RdRp and remdesivir. We show that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is under purifying selection, that potential escape mutations are rare in circulating lineages, and that those mutations, where present, do not destabilise RdRp. In more than 56,000 viral genomes from 105 countries from the first pandemic wave, we found negative selective pressure affecting nsp12 (Tajima's D = -2.62), with potential antiviral escape mutations in only 0.3% of sequenced genomes. Potential escape mutations included known key residues, such as Nsp12:Val473 and Nsp12:Arg555. Of the potential escape mutations involved globally, in silico structural models found that they were unlikely to be associated with loss of stability in RdRp. No potential escape mutation was found in a local cohort of remdesivir treated patients. Collectively, these findings indicate that RdRp is a suitable drug target, and that remdesivir does not seem to exert high selective pressure. We anticipate our framework to be the starting point of a larger effort for a global monitoring of drug resistance throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\",\"Favipiravir is a nucleoside analogue which has been licensed to treat influenza in the event of a new pandemic. We previously described a favipiravir resistant influenza A virus generated by in vitro passage in presence of drug with two mutations: K229R in PB1, which conferred resistance at a cost to polymerase activity, and P653L in PA, which compensated for the cost of polymerase activity. However, the clinical relevance of these mutations is unclear as the mutations have not been found in natural isolates and it is unknown whether viruses harbouring these mutations would replicate or transmit in vivo. Here, we infected ferrets with a mix of wild type p(H1N1) 2009 and corresponding favipiravir-resistant virus and tested for replication and transmission in the absence of drug. Favipiravir-resistant virus successfully infected ferrets and was transmitted by both contact transmission and respiratory droplet routes. However, sequencing revealed the mutation that conferred resistance, K229R, decreased in frequency over time within ferrets. Modelling revealed that due to a fitness advantage for the PA P653L mutant, reassortment with the wild-type virus to gain wild-type PB1 segment in vivo resulted in the loss of the PB1 resistance mutation K229R. We demonstrated that this fitness advantage of PA P653L in the background of our starting virus A/England/195/2009 was due to a maladapted PA in first wave isolates from the 2009 pandemic. We show there is no fitness advantage of P653L in more recent pH1N1 influenza A viruses. Therefore, whilst favipiravir-resistant virus can transmit in vivo, the likelihood that the resistance mutation is retained in the absence of drug pressure may vary depending on the genetic background of the starting viral strain.\",\"We evaluated the clinical, virological and safety outcomes of lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir-interferon (IFN)-\\u03b2-1a, hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir in comparison to standard of care (control) in coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) inpatients requiring oxygen and/or ventilatory support.\",\"Retreatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) resulted in a rate of sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment completion (SVR12) of >90% in HCV genotype 1 (GT1) patients who previously failed a regimen of sofosbuvir plus an NS5A inhibitor (NS5Ai). This study investigated the prevalence and impact of baseline NS3 and NS5A resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) on the efficacy of G/P in prior GT1 sofosbuvir+NS5Ai failures and the persistence of treatment-emergent RASs.\",\"The COVID-19 pandemic has severely destructed human life worldwide, with no suitable treatment until now. SARS-CoV-2 virus is unprecedented, resistance against number of therapeutics and spreading rapidly with high mortality, which warrants the need to discover new effective drugs to combat this situation. This current study is undertaken to explore the antiviral potential of marine algal compounds to inhibit the viral entry and its multiplication using computational analysis. Among the proven drug discovery targets of SARS-CoV-2, spike glycoprotein and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease are responsible for the virus attachment and viral genome replication in the host cell. In this study, the above-mentioned drug targets were docked with marine algal compounds (sulfated polysaccharides, polysaccharide derivatives and polyphenols) using molecular docking tools (AutoDockTools). The obtained results indicate that \\u03ba-carrageenan, laminarin, eckol, trifucol and \\u03b2-D-galactose are the top-ranking compounds showing better docking scores with SARS-CoV-2 targets, than the current experimental COVID-19 antiviral drugs like dexamethasone, remdesivir, favipiravir and MIV-150. Further, molecular dynamic simulation, ADMET and density functional theory calculations were evaluated to substantiate the findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on in silico analysis of aforesaid algal metabolites against SARS-CoV-2 targets. This study concludes that these metabolites can be curative for COVID-19 in the hour of need after further validations in in vitro and in vivo testings.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.\",\"The current recommendation for treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV patients includes the combination of sofosbuvir (SOF) and daclatasvir (DCV). DCV should be used at different doses to compensate for interactions with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Up to three pills a day might be required which will significantly add to the pill burden of these patients. In this study, we have used a single-tablet approach to treating HCV-HIV coinfection.\",\"Replication of RNA viruses is characterized by exploration of sequence space which facilitates their adaptation to changing environments. It is generally accepted that such exploration takes place mainly in response to positive selection, and that further diversification is boosted by modifications of virus population size, particularly bottleneck events. Our recent results with hepatitis C virus (HCV) have shown that the expansion in sequence space of a viral clone continues despite prolonged replication in a stable cell culture environment. Diagnosis of the expansion was based on the quantification of diversity indices, the occurrence of intra-population mutational waves (variations in mutant frequencies), and greater individual residue variations in mutant spectra than those anticipated from sequence alignments in data banks. In the present report, we review our previous results, and show additionally that mutational waves in amplicons from the NS5A-NS5B-coding region are equally prominent during HCV passage in the absence or presence of the mutagenic nucleotide analogues favipiravir or ribavirin. In addition, by extending our previous analysis to amplicons of the NS3- and NS5A-coding region, we provide further evidence of the incongruence between amino acid conservation scores in mutant spectra from infected patients and in the Los Alamos National Laboratory HCV data banks. We hypothesize that these observations have as a common origin a permanent state of HCV population disequilibrium even upon extensive viral replication in the absence of external selective constraints or changes in population size. Such a persistent disequilibrium-revealed by the changing composition of the mutant spectrum-may facilitate finding alternative mutational pathways for HCV antiviral resistance. The possible significance of our model for other genetically variable viruses is discussed.\",\"Direct-Acting agents (DAAs) target and inhibit essential viral replication proteins. They have revolutionized the treatment of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection reaching high levels of sustained virologic response. However, the detection of basal resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) to DAAs in na\\u00efve patients could be important in predicting the treatment outcome in some patients exhibiting failures to DAA-based therapies. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the presence of RASs as minority variants within intra-host viral populations, and assess their relationship to response to therapy on a multiple times relapser patient infected chronically with HCV.\",\"The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing with no direct treatment for the disease. Few repurposed drugs, such as Remdesivir, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir, and Ritonavir, are being tested against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is the drug of choice for Ebola virus disease and has been authorized for emergency use. This drug acts against SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2. RdRp of viruses is prone to mutations that confer drug resistance. A recent study by Pachetti et al. in 2020 identified the P323L mutation in the RdRp protein of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we aimed to determine the potency of lead compounds similar to Remdesivir, which can be used as an alternative when variants of SARS-CoV-2 develop resistance due to RdRp mutations. The initial screening yielded 704 compounds that were 90% similar to the control drug, Remdesivir. On further evaluation through drugability and antiviral inhibition percentage analyses, we shortlisted 32 and seven compounds, respectively. These seven compounds were further analyzed for their molecular interactions, which revealed that all seven compounds interacted with RdRp with higher affinity than Remdesivir under native conditions. However, three compounds failed to interact with the mutant protein with higher affinity than Remdesivir. Dynamic cross-correlation matrix (DCCM) and vector field collective motions analyses were performed to identify the precise movements of docked complexes' residues. Furthermore, the compound SCHEMBL20144212 showed a high affinity for native and mutant proteins and might provide an alternative against SARS-CoV-2 variants that might confer resistance to Remdesivir. Further validations by in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of our lead compounds for their inhibition against SARS-CoV-2.\",\"Antiviral therapeutics is one effective avenue to control and end this devastating COVID-19 pandemic. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 has been recognized as a valuable target of antivirals. However, the cell-free SARS-CoV-2 RdRp biochemical assay requires the conversion of nucleotide prodrugs into the active triphosphate forms, which regularly occurs in cells yet is a complicated multiple-step chemical process in vitro, and thus hinders the utility of this cell-free assay in the rapid discovery of RdRp inhibitors. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 exoribonuclease provides the proof-reading capacity to viral RdRp, thus creates relatively high resistance threshold of viral RdRp to nucleotide analog inhibitors, which must be examined and evaluated in the development of this class of antivirals. Here, we report a cell-based assay to evaluate the efficacy of nucleotide analog compounds against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and assess their tolerance to viral exoribonuclease-mediated proof-reading. By testing seven commonly used nucleotide analog viral polymerase inhibitors, Remdesivir, Molnupiravir, Ribavirin, Favipiravir, Penciclovir, Entecavir and Tenofovir, we found that both Molnupiravir and Remdesivir showed the strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with EC50 value of 0.22 \\u03bcM and 0.67 \\u03bcM, respectively. Moreover, our results suggested that exoribonuclease nsp14 increases resistance of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp to nucleotide analog inhibitors. We also determined that Remdesivir presented the highest resistance to viral exoribonuclease activity in cells. Therefore, we have developed a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 RdRp assay which can be deployed to discover SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitors that are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 patients.\",\"Limited literature on the prevalence of baseline resistance associated substitutions (BL-RAS) among HCV-HIV co-infected patients and their association with treatment outcomes is available especially from India. Hence, the present study aimed to study naturally occurring RAS among non-cirrhotic HCV-HIV co-infected patients and their impact on the response to anti-HCV therapy.\",\"NS5B polymerase inhibitors represent the cornerstone of the present treatment of Hepatitis C virus infection (HCV). Naturally occurring substitution mutations to NS5B inhibitors have been recorded. The current study intended to demonstrate possible natural direct acting antiviral (DAA)-mutations of the HCV NS5B region in HCV patients in Minia governorate, Egypt.\",\"The SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription complex (RTC) comprising nonstructural protein (nsp) 2-16 plays crucial roles in viral replication, reducing the efficacy of broad-spectrum nucleoside analog drugs such as remdesivir and evading innate immune responses. Most studies target a specific viral component of the RTC such as the main protease or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In contrast, our strategy is to target multiple conserved domains of the RTC to prevent SARS-CoV-2 genome replication and to create a high barrier to viral resistance and/or evasion of antiviral drugs. We show that the clinically safe Zn-ejector drugs disulfiram and ebselen can target conserved Zn[2+] sites in SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 and nsp14 and inhibit nsp13 ATPase and nsp14 exoribonuclease activities. As the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 domain targeted by disulfiram/ebselen is involved in RNA fidelity control, our strategy allows coupling of the Zn-ejector drug with a broad-spectrum nucleoside analog that would otherwise be excised by the nsp14 proofreading domain. As proof-of-concept, we show that disulfiram/ebselen, when combined with remdesivir, can synergistically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells. We present a mechanism of action and the advantages of our multitargeting strategy, which can be applied to any type of coronavirus with conserved Zn[2+] sites.\",\"RNA viruses demonstrate a vast range of variants, called quasispecies, due to error-prone replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Although live attenuated vaccines are effective in preventing RNA virus infection, there is a risk of reversal to virulence after their administration. To test the hypothesis that high-fidelity viral polymerase reduces the diversity of influenza virus quasispecies, resulting in inhibition of reversal of the attenuated phenotype, we first screened for a high-fidelity viral polymerase using serial virus passages under selection with a guanosine analog ribavirin. Consequently, we identified a Leu66-to-Val single amino acid mutation in polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1). The high-fidelity phenotype of PB1-L66V was confirmed using next-generation sequencing analysis and biochemical assays with the purified influenza viral polymerase. As expected, PB1-L66V showed at least two-times-lower mutation rates and decreased misincorporation rates, compared to the wild type (WT). Therefore, we next generated an attenuated PB1-L66V virus with a temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype based on FluMist, a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) that can restrict virus propagation by ts mutations, and examined the genetic stability of the attenuated PB1-L66V virus using serial virus passages. The PB1-L66V mutation prevented reversion of the ts phenotype to the WT phenotype, suggesting that the high-fidelity viral polymerase could contribute to generating an LAIV with high genetic stability, which would not revert to the pathogenic virus.IMPORTANCE The LAIV currently in use is prescribed for actively immunizing individuals aged 2 to 49 years. However, it is not approved for infants and elderly individuals, who actually need it the most, because it might prolong virus propagation and cause an apparent infection in these individuals, due to their weak immune systems. Recently, reversion of the ts phenotype of the LAIV strain currently in use to a pathogenic virus was demonstrated in cultured cells. Thus, the generation of mutations associated with enhanced virulence in LAIV should be considered. In this study, we isolated a novel influenza virus strain with a Leu66-to-Val single amino acid mutation in PB1 that displayed a significantly higher fidelity than the WT. We generated a novel LAIV candidate strain harboring this mutation. This strain showed higher genetic stability and no ts phenotype reversion. Thus, our high-fidelity strain might be useful for the development of a safer LAIV.\",\"The treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a challenge. The efficacy of several drugs has been evaluated and variability in drug response has been observed. Pharmacogenetics could explain this variation and improve patients' outcomes with this complex disease; nevertheless, several disease-related issues must be carefully reviewed in the pharmacogenetic study of COVID-19 treatment. We aimed to describe the pharmacogenetic variants reported for drugs used for COVID-19 treatment (remdesivir, oseltamivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, azithromycin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and dexamethasone). In addition, other factors relevant to the design of pharmacogenetic studies were mentioned. Variants in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C8, CY2D6, ABCB1, ABCC2, and SLCO1B1, among other variants, could be included in pharmacogenetic studies of COVID-19 treatment. Besides, nongenetic factors such as drug-drug interactions and inflammation should be considered in the search for personalized therapy of COVID-19.\",\"Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs are associated with high (>95%) sustained virological response at 12 weeks (SVR12) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. There is a paucity of data regarding the characteristics and re-treatment outcomes of DAA treatment failure patients. In a retrospective analysis of the prospectively collected database, we assessed the outcomes of re-treatment among patients with previous DAA failure. Patients' characteristics, viral characteristics, including resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) in a subgroup of patients, SVR12, and clinical outcomes were studied. Of 40 patients with DAA failure, among whom 36 were retreated, mean age was 45.7 years, 63.9% (n = 23) were male, 63.9% (n = 23) had a genotype-3 infection and 63.9% (n = 23) were cirrhotic. The re-treatment regimens included a combination of pan-genotypic DAA, mainly sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with or without ribavirin. Three patients who declined retreatment and one who was still on treatment was excluded. For patients who completed re-treatment, SVR12 was 100% irrespective of genotypes. SVR12 among genotype 3 was 75% (15 of 20) when lost to follow-up was considered a treatment failure. Six patients died due to liver-related causes, including five (83.3%) with hepatocellular carcinoma. RAS analysis in 17 randomly selected patients did not reveal any dominant substitutions in NS5A or NS5B region affecting SVR12, though several novel mutations were observed. In conclusion, re-treatment of CHC patients with prior DAA failure using pan-genotypic DAA is associated with high SVR12 rates irrespective of genotype or the presence of RAS.\",\"Molecular surveillance by whole-genome sequencing was used to monitor the susceptibility of circulating influenza A viruses to three polymerase complex inhibitors. A total of 12 resistance substitutions were found among 285 genomes analyzed, but none were associated with high levels of resistance. Natural resistance to these influenza A antivirals is currently uncommon.\",\"Backtracking, the reverse motion of the transcriptase enzyme on the nucleic acid template, is a universal regulatory feature of transcription in cellular organisms but its role in viruses is not established. Here we present evidence that backtracking extends into the viral realm, where backtracking by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) may aid viral transcription and replication. Structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp bound to the essential nsp13 helicase and RNA suggested the helicase facilitates backtracking. We use cryo-electron microscopy, RNA-protein crosslinking, and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp backtracking. The results establish that the single-stranded 3'-segment of the product-RNA generated by backtracking extrudes through the RdRp NTP-entry tunnel, that a mismatched nucleotide at the product-RNA 3'-end frays and enters the NTP-entry tunnel to initiate backtracking, and that nsp13 stimulates RdRp backtracking. Backtracking may aid proofreading, a crucial process for SARS-CoV-2 resistance against antivirals.\",\"Despite strict control measures implemented worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage. Several drugs, including lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, and remdesivir, have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 during the past year. While most of the drugs failed to display efficacy in treating COVID-19, scientists have encouraged herd immunity to control the pandemic. Immunity generated after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 is precarious, as indicated by real-world evidence in the form of epidemiological data from Manaus, Brazil. Vaccines using different platforms are therefore the most promising approach to help us return to normality. Although several vaccines have been authorized for emergency use, there are still many concerns regarding their accessibility, the vaccination rate, and most importantly, their efficacy in preventing infection with emerging virus variants. Continued virus surveillance and rapid redesign of new vaccines to counter new variants are crucial to fighting COVID-19. Rapid production and extensive vaccination are also essential to preventing the emergence of new variants. Nevertheless, antivirals including monoclonal antibodies and oral medicines need to be developed in light of uncertainties with regard to vaccination. In the battle between humans and SARS-CoV-2, the speed with which we fight the virus, and especially its emerging variants, is the key to winning.\",\"We examined the safety and efficacy of a treatment protocol containing Favipiravir for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.\",\"Viral resistance is a major reason for virological failure in patients being treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for chronic HCV infection. However, the importance of viral resistance mainly depends on the DAA regimen and HCV genotype. For first-line therapy with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) or velpatasvir/sofosbuvir (VEL/SOF) no general baseline resistance analysis is required because of the high antiviral activity and high barrier to resistance. If available, resistance testing may help to optimise therapy in certain subgroups of patients with HCV genotype 3 and other rare HCV geno/subtypes. Voxilaprevir/velpatasvir/sofosbuvir (VOX/VEL/SOF) is the first choice for the second-line treatment of patients following a previous DAA failure, with rates of viral eradication above 90% irrespective of the presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs). However, in resource-limited settings, only first-generation DAAs may be available for second-line therapy. Here, RASs selected during initial antiviral therapy should be considered if testing is available and rescue treatment should include a switch to a regimen with a new DAA class to optimise treatment response. Patients with HCV genotype 3 are overrepresented in the group who experience DAA treatment failure. Limited data are available for third-line therapies, but promising results have been achieved with G/P plus SOF or VOX/VEL/SOF with or without ribavirin for 12 to 24 weeks; these regimens should be administered irrespective of a patient's RAS profile.\",\"The use of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) in patients with chronic HCV genotype (GT) 1 infection results in sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of 95%-97%, but 3%-5% of patients experience virologic failure. We observed 41 patients infected with HCV subtype 1b who failed previous treatment with DAAs, including 37 subjects (90.2%) with liver cirrhosis. In total, 30 (73.2%) subjects previously received NS5A inhibitors of the first generation (ledipasvir, daclatasvir, or ombitasvir) and 11 subjects (26.8%) received NS5A inhibitors of the second generation (velpatasvir). All patients received retreatment with a combination of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir (3D) with sofosbuvir (SOF) and ribavirin (RBV). We compared SVR12 rates depending on fibrosis stage, presence of just single or double NS5A mutation (L31M/V/I and/or Y93H), and the generation of previously used NS5A inhibitors. Observed SVR12 rates were as follows: 97.6% (40/41 patients) overall; 100% in patients without cirrhosis (n = 4) versus 97.3% in those with cirrhosis (n = 37); 100% with single L31M/V/I or Y93H mutation (n = 22) versus 94.4% with double mutations (n = 18); 100% in patients who failed previous treatment with first-generation (n = 30) versus 90.9% in those who failed previous treatment with second-generation NS5A inhibitors (n = 11). Retreatment with 3D + SOF + RBV was highly effective and safe in patients with chronic HCV GT1b infection, including those with liver cirrhosis, who failed previous treatment with DAA containing NS5A inhibitors. Fibrosis stage and single or simultaneous presence of NS5A RASs L31M/V/I and Y93H at the baseline, as well as the generation of previously used NS5A inhibitors, did not impact SVR12 rates.\",\"The objective of this trial is to assess whether early antiviral therapy in outpatients with COVID-19 with either favipiravir plus lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir alone, or favipiravir alone, is associated with a decrease in viral load of SARS-CoV-2 compared with placebo.\",\"Despite the current highly effective therapies with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), some patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection still do not achieve sustained virological response (SVR) and require retreatment. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SVV) is recommended as the first-line retreatment option for most patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of SVV as salvage therapy after at least one course of DAA.\",\"SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA virus that requires an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for replication of its viral genome. Nucleoside analogs such as Remdesivir and \\u03b2-d-N[4]-hydroxycytidine are antiviral candidates and may function as chain terminators or induce viral mutations, thus impairing RdRp function. Recently disclosed Cryo-EM structures of apo, RNA-bound, and inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV-2 RdRp provided insight into the inhibitor-bound structure by capturing the enzyme with its reaction product: Remdesivir covalently bound to the RNA primer strand. To gain a structural understanding of the binding of this and several other nucleoside analogs in the precatalytic state, molecular models were developed that predict the noncovalent interactions to a complex of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, RNA, and catalytic metal cations. MM-GBSA evaluation of these interactions is consistent with resistance-conferring mutations and existing structure-activity relationship (SAR) data. Therefore, this approach may yield insights into antiviral mechanisms and guide the development of experimental drugs for COVID-19 treatment.\",\"Antiviral drugs have been used to treat the ever-growing number of coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Consequently, unprecedented amounts of such drug residues discharging into ambient waters raise concerns on the potential ecotoxicological effects to aquatic lives, as well as development of antiviral drug-resistance in wildlife. Here, we estimated the occurrence, fate and ecotoxicological risk of 11 therapeutic agents suggested as drugs for COVID-19 treatment and their 13 metabolites in wastewater and environmental waters, based on drug consumption, physical-chemical property, and ecotoxicological and pharmacological data for the drugs, with the aid of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling. Our results suggest that the removal efficiencies at conventional wastewater treatment plants will remain low (<20%) for half of the substances, and consequently, high drug residues (e.g. 7402 ng/L ribavirin, 4231 ng/L favipiravir, 730 ng/L lopinavir, 319 ng/L remdesivir; each combined for both unchanged forms and metabolites; and when each drug is administered to 100 patients out of 100,000 populations on a day) can be present in secondary effluents and persist in the environmental waters. Ecotoxicological risk in receiving river waters can be high (risk quotient >1) by a use of favipiravir, lopinavir, umifenovir and ritonavir, and medium (risk quotient >0.1) by a use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and ribavirin, while the risk will remain low (risk quotient <0.1) for dexamethasone and oseltamivir. The potential of wild animals acquiring antiviral drug resistance was estimated to be low. Our prediction suggests a pressing need for proper usage and waste management of antiviral drugs as well as for improving removal efficiencies of drug residues in wastewater.\",\"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may lead to the cytokine storm syndrome which may cause acute respiratory failure syndrome and death. Our aim was to investigate the therapeutic effects of infliximab, intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIg) or combination therapy in patients with severe COVID-19 disease admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).\",\"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne bunyavirus that causes Rift Valley fever (RVF), a zoonotic disease of wild and domestic ruminants, causing serious economic losses and a threat to human health that could be controlled by vaccination. Though RVF vaccines are available for livestock, no RVF vaccines have been licensed for veterinary use in non-endemic countries nor for human populations in RVF risk areas. In a recent work, we showed that favipiravir, a promising drug with antiviral activity against a number of RNA viruses, led to the extinction of RVFV from infected cell cultures. Nevertheless, certain drug concentrations allowed the recovery of a virus variant showing increased resistance to favipiravir. In this work, we characterized this novel resistant variant both at genomic and phenotypic level in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the resistant virus displayed reduced growth rates in C6/36 insect cells but not in mammalian cell lines, and was highly attenuated but still immunogenic in vivo. Some amino acid substitutions were identified in the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) gene and in the virus encoded type I-interferon (IFN-I) antagonist NSs gene, in catalytic core motifs and nuclear localization associated positions, respectively. These data may help to characterize novel potential virulence markers, offering additional strategies for further safety improvements of RVF live attenuated vaccine candidates.\",\"HCV genotype 4 dominates the HCV epidemic in Egypt. Drug resistance was the most serious side effect that reflects bad clinical outcome. Several studies had demonstrated that baseline serum interferon-\\u03b3-inducible-protein 10 (IP-10) levels and interleukin 28B polymorphisms were associated with the resistance to the standard of care pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin (PEG-IFN\\u03b1/RBV) therapy and development of post-treatment relapse. Our purpose was to assess the predictive value of combining IP-10 levels and IL28B genotypes to PEG-IFN\\u03b1/RBV therapy response in Egyptian chronic HCV infection patients with genotype 4. Ninety Egyptian patients chronically infected by HCV genotype-4 treated with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin (PEG-IFN\\u03b1/RBV) therapy were enrolled. Serum IP-10 levels were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay pre- and post- treatment. IL-28B (rs12979860 and rs8099917) polymorphisms were performed by PCR-RFLP in all patients. Overall, 38 patients (42.2%) achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) and 52 (57.8%) patients have non-viral response (NVR). Pretreatment serum IP-10 mean levels were significantly lower in patients who achieved SVR than in NVR (P<0.05). CC genotype in IL28B polymorphism (rs12979860) was the favorable genotype as 65.8% achieved SVR, while TT genotype in IL-28B polymorphism (rs8099917) was the favorable genotype as 81.5% achieved SVR. Baseline IP-10 was significantly correlated to genotypes CC in rs12979860 and TT in rs8099917. Combined use of serum baseline IP-10 levels with IL-28B polymorphisms could improve the prediction of SVR to PEG-IFN\\u03b1/RBV therapy in Egyptian chronic HCV infection patients with genotype 4.\",\"The Egyptian National Committee of Viral Hepatitis program is the leading national hepatitis C virus (HCV) management program globally. However, limited data is available about the effect of the new directly acting antiviral agents on the cardiovascular system.\",\"Remdesivir (RDV) exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and is currently the only drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19. However, little is currently known about the potential for pre-existing resistance to RDV and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification that might impact RDV efficacy as the virus continue to spread globally. In this study, >90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates, including sequences from recently emerged United Kingdom and South Africa variants, and >300 from mink isolates were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in \\u22650.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates. Importantly, the coronavirus Nsp12 mutations previously selected in vitro in the presence of RDV were identified in only 2 isolates (0.002%) within all the analyzed sequences. In addition, among the sequence variants observed in \\u22650.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition. In summary, the low diversity and high genetic stability of the RNA replication complex observed over time and in the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants suggests a minimal global risk of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 resistance to RDV.\",\"The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into an emergent global pandemic. Many drugs without established efficacy are being used to treat COVID-19 patients either as an offlabel/compassionate use or as a clinical trial. Although drug repurposing is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost, there is a need to make predictions on success before the start of therapy. For the optimum use of these repurposed drugs, many factors should be considered such as drug-gene or dug-drug interactions, drug toxicity, and patient co-morbidity. There is limited data on the pharmacogenomics of these agents and this may constitute an obstacle for successful COVID-19 therapy. This article reviewed the available human genome interactions with some promising repurposed drugs for COVID-19 management. These drugs include chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), atazanavir (ATV), favipiravir (FVP), nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), oseltamivir, remdesivir, anakinra, tocilizumab (TCZ), eculizumab, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) regulators, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide. Drug-gene variant pairs that may alter the therapeutic outcomes in COVID-19 patients are presented. The major drug variant pairs that associated with variations in clinical efficacy include CQ/HCQ (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, ACE2, and HO-1); azithromycin (ABCB1); LPV/r (SLCO1B1, ABCB1, ABCC2 and CYP3A); NVP (ABCC10); oseltamivir (CES1 and ABCB1); remdesivir (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and OATP1B1); anakinra (IL-1a); and TCZ (IL6R and FCGR3A). The major drug variant pairs that associated with variations in adverse effects include CQ/HCQ (G6PD; hemolysis and ABCA4; retinopathy), ATV (MDR1 and UGT1A1*28; hyperbilirubinemia; and APOA5; dyslipidemia), NVP (HLA-DRB1*01, HLA-B*3505 and CYP2B6; skin rash and MDR1; hepatotoxicity), and EFV (CYP2B6; depression and suicidal tendencies).\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) accounts for hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation. This virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. According to the WHO, about 71 million people have chronic HCV infections around the globe in 2020, and hence, it is a plague of humankind. The credit of discovery of HCV goes to Michael Houghton, Harvey Alter, and Charles Rice for which they are awarded 2020 Nobel Prize in Medicine. Their contribution has given better hope to mankind to cure HCV for the first time in the history. With the use of pegylated interferon and ribavirin jointly, higher SVR has been found comparatively, even in patients with chronic liver diseases. However, due to excessive pain tolerated by patients, interferon (IFN)-based therapy is rapidly being replaced with IFN-free DAA regimens. With the onset of resistance to DAA drugs, CRISPR-Cas system can be used to modify the viral genome to impair their ability to develop resistance. How to cite this article: Laugi H.

Recently, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, known as B.1.1.7, was first detected in the United Kingdom and is spreading in several other countries, heightening public health concern and raising questions as to the resulting effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic interventions. We and others previously identified host-directed therapies with antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Less prone to the development of therapy resistance, host-directed drugs represent promising therapeutic options to combat emerging viral variants as host genes possess a lower propensity to mutate compared to viral genes. Here, in the first study of the full-length B.1.1.7 variant virus , we find two host-directed drugs, plitidepsin (aplidin; inhibits translation elongation factor eEF1A) and ralimetinib (inhibits p38 MAP kinase cascade), as well as remdesivir, to possess similar antiviral activity against both the early-lineage SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.1.7 variant, evaluated in both human gastrointestinal and lung epithelial cell lines. We find that plitidepsin is over an order of magnitude more potent than remdesivir against both viruses. These results highlight the importance of continued development of host-directed therapeutics to combat current and future coronavirus variant outbreaks.\",\"This study aimed to investigate the role of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) to direct-acting-antivirals (DAAs) in HCV genotype 3 (GT3).\",\"The use of remdesivir to treat COVID-19 will likely continue before clinical trials are completed. Due to the lengthening pandemic and evolving nature of the virus, predicting potential residues prone to mutation is crucial for the management of remdesivir resistance. Using a rational ligand-based interface design complemented with mutational mapping, we generated a total of 100,000 mutations and provided insight into the functional outcomes of mutations in the remdesivir-binding site in nsp12 subunit of RdRp. After designing 46 residues in the remdesivir-binding site of nsp12, the designs retained 97%-98% sequence identity, suggesting that very few mutations in nsp12 are required for SARS-CoV-2 to attain remdesivir resistance. Several mutants displayed decreased binding affinity to remdesivir, suggesting drug resistance. These hotspot residues had a higher probability of undergoing selective mutation and thus conferring remdesivir resistance. Identifying the potential residues prone to mutation improves our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 drug resistance and COVID-19 pathogenesis.\",\"ABMA and its analogue DABMA are two molecules of the adamantane family known to perturbate the endosomal pathway and to inhibit cell infection of several RNA and DNA viruses. Their activity against Rabies Virus (RABV) infection has already been demonstrated in vitro. (Wu et al., 2017, 2019). Here, we describe in more details their mechanism of action by comparison to Arbidol (umifenovir) and Ribavirin, two broad spectrum antivirals against emerging viruses such as Lassa, Ebola, influenza and Hantaan viruses. ABMA and DABMA, delivered 2 h pre-infection, inhibit RABV infection in vitro with an EC50 of 7.8 \\u03bcM and 14 \\u03bcM, respectively. They act at post-entry, by causing RABV accumulation within the endosomal compartment and DABMA specifically diminishes the expression of the GTPase Rab7a controlling the fusion of early endosomes to late endosomes or lysosomes. This may suggest that ABMA and DABMA act at different stages of the late endosomal pathway as supported by their different profile of synergy/antagonism with the fusion inhibitor Arbidol. This difference is further confirmed by the RABV mutants induced by successive passages under increasing selective pressure showing a particular involvement of the viral G protein in the DABMA inhibition while ABMA inhibition induces less mutations dispersed in the M, G and L viral proteins. These results suggest new therapeutic perspectives against rabies.\",\"At this time, there is no specific therapeutic or vaccine for treatment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Hence, available drugs for treatment of other viral infections may be useful to treat COVID-19.\",\"The prolonged treatment of immunosuppressed (IS) individuals with anti-influenza monotherapies may lead to the emergence of drug-resistant variants. Herein, we evaluated oseltamivir and polymerase inhibitors combinations against influenza A/H3N2 infections in an IS mouse model. Mice were IS with cyclophosphamide and infected with 3 \\u00d7 10[3] PFU of a mouse-adapted A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2) virus. Forty-eight hours post-infection, the animals started oseltamivir, favipiravir or baloxavir marboxil (BXM) as single or combined therapies for 10 days. Weight losses, survival rates and lung viral titers (LVTs) were determined. The neuraminidase (NA) and polymerase genes from lung viral samples were sequenced. All untreated animals died. Oseltamivir and favipiravir monotherapies only delayed mortality (the mean day to death (MDD) of 21.4 and 24 compared to 11.4 days for those untreated) while a synergistic improvement in survival (80%) and LVT reduction was observed in the oseltamivir/favipiravir group compared to the oseltamivir group. BXM alone or in double/triple combination provided a complete protection and significantly reduced LVTs. Oseltamivir and BXM monotherapies induced the E119V (NA) and I38T (PA) substitutions, respectively, while no resistance mutation was detected with combinations. We found that the multiple dose regimen of BXM alone provided superior benefits compared to oseltamivir and favipiravir monotherapies. Moreover, we suggest the potential for drug combinations to reduce the incidence of resistance.\",\"The response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been hampered by lack of an effective severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antiviral therapy. Here we report the use of remdesivir in a patient with COVID-19 and the prototypic genetic antibody deficiency X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA). Despite evidence of complement activation and a robust T cell response, the patient developed persistent SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis, without progressing to multi-organ involvement. This unusual clinical course is consistent with a contribution of antibodies to both viral clearance and progression to severe disease. In the absence of these confounders, we take an experimental medicine approach to examine the in vivo utility of remdesivir. Over two independent courses of treatment, we observe a temporally correlated clinical and virological response, leading to clinical resolution and viral clearance, with no evidence of acquired drug resistance. We therefore provide evidence for the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in vivo, and its potential benefit in selected patients.\",\"Identification and characterization of developed antiviral drug resistance mutations are key to the success of antiviral therapies against hepatitis C virus (HCV), which remains a worldwide highly prevalent pathogenic disease. Although most studies focus on HCV genotypes 1, 2 or 3, the investigation of drug resistance in HCV genotype 4, predominant in North Africa, is especially significant in Egypt.\",\"There are limited data on patients with chronic HCV infection in whom combination voxilaprevir (VOX), velpatasvir (VEL), sofosbuvir (SOF) retreatment fails. Thus, we aimed to assess treatment failure and rescue treatment options in these patients.\",\"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is well known as a novel member of the coronavirus family which caused a sudden outbreak of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in China that quickly developed into a global pandemic. No effective approaches are found as yet for the therapy and epidemiological control of this new virus. We searched the literature in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, and MeSH, for articles and abstracts describing SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, pneumonia, clinical trials, drug, treatment, and medicine.Areas covered: The present study aimed to comprehensively overview the current literature on effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.Expert opinion: Since the beginning of this pandemic disease, many studies have been conducted to find effective drugs to prevent COVID-19, because there are no specific drugs for the treatment of this disease. Most of these drugs with the antiviral potential effect toward COVID-19 are already used as the treatment of other infectious diseases. Some drugs that show the promising therapeutic potential in the initial clinical studies include remdesivir as an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and favipiravir as an inhibitor of virus replication. Currently, remdesivir received the FDA authorizes to use as an experimental drug for emergency use in COVID-19 patients.\",\"The GETAFIX trial will test the hypothesis that favipiravir is a more effective treatment for COVID-19 infection in patients who have early stage disease, compared to current standard of care. This study will also provide an important opportunity to investigate the safety and tolerability of favipiravir, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of this drug and mechanisms of resistance in the context of COVID-19 infection, as well as the effect of favipiravir on hospitalisation duration and the post COVID-19 health and psycho-social wellbeing of patients recruited to the study.\",\"Patients with inherited blood disorders (IBLD) have a high risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

At the time of this review, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in over 40 million cases and associated with 1.1 million deaths worldwide. Current management strategies for COVID-19 are largely supportive, and while there are more than 2000 interventional clinical trials registered with the U.S. National Library of Medicine (clinicaltrials.gov), results that can clarify benefits and risks of candidate therapies are only gradually becoming available. We herein describe recent advances in understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology and potential therapeutic targets that are involved in viral entry into host cells, viral spread in the body, and the subsequent COVID-19 progression. We highlight two major lines of therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment: 1) repurposing the existing drugs for use in COVID-19 patients, such as antiviral medications (e.g., remdesivir) and immunomodulators (e.g., dexamethasone) which were previously approved for other disease conditions, and 2) novel biological products that are designed to target specific molecules that are involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, including neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, such as REGN-COV2 (an antibody cocktail), as well as recombinant human soluble ACE2 protein to counteract SARS-CoV-2 binding to the transmembrane ACE2 receptor in target cells. Finally, we discuss potential drug resistance mechanisms and provide thoughts regarding clinical trial design to address the diversity in COVID-19 clinical manifestation. Of note, preventive vaccines, cell and gene therapies are not within the scope of the current review.\",\"Multidrug resistance in microbes poses a major health crisis and demands for the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents. The recent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has raised a public health emergency in almost all the countries of the world. Unlike viruses, a bacterium plays a significant role in various environmental issues such as bioremediation. Furthermore, biosurfactants produced by various bacterial species have an edge over traditionally produced chemical surfactants for its biodegradability, low toxicity and better interfacial activity with various applications in agriculture and industry. This special issue focuses on the global perspective of drug discovery for various antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal agents for infectious diseases. The issue also emphasizes the ongoing developments and the role of microbes in environmental remediation. We wish the articles published in this issue will enhance the current understanding in microbiology among the readers, and serve as the \\\"seed of an idea\\\" for drug development for ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\",\"Coronaviridae is a peculiar viral family, with a very large RNA genome and characteristic appearance, endowed with remarkable tendency to transfer from animals to humans. Since the beginning of the 21st century, three highly transmissible and pathogenic coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier and caused deadly pneumonia, inflicting severe outbreaks and causing human health emergencies of inconceivable magnitude. Indeed, in the past two decades, two human coronaviruses emerged causing serious respiratory illness: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), causing more than 10,000 cumulative cases, with mortality rates of 10 % for SARS-CoV-1 and 34.4 % for MERS-CoV. More recently, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged in China and has been identified as the etiological agent of the recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. It has rapidly spread throughout the world, causing nearly 22 million cases and \\u223c 770,000 deaths worldwide, with an estimated mortality rate of \\u223c3.6 %, hence posing serious challenges for adequate and effective prevention and treatment. Currently, with the exception of the nucleotide analogue prodrug remdesivir, and despite several efforts, there is no known specific, proven, pharmacological treatment capable of efficiently and rapidly inducing viral containment and clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as no broad-spectrum drug for other human pathogenic coronaviruses. Another confounding factor is the paucity of molecular information regarding the tendency of coronaviruses to acquire drug resistance, a gap that should be filled in order to optimize the efficacy of antiviral drugs. In this light, the present review provides a systematic update on the current knowledge of the marked global efforts towards the development of antiviral strategies aimed at coping with the infection sustained by SARS-CoV-2 and other human pathogenic coronaviruses, displaying drug resistance profiles. The attention has been focused on antiviral drugs mainly targeting viral protease, RNA polymerase and spike glycoprotein, that have been tested in vitro and/or in clinical trials as well as on promising compounds proven to be active against coronaviruses by an in silico drug repurposing approach. In this respect, novel insights on compounds, identified by structure-based virtual screening on the DrugBank database endowed by multi-targeting profile, are also reported. We specifically identified 14 promising compounds characterized by a good in silico binding affinity towards, at least, two of the four studied targets (viral and host proteins). Among which, ceftolozane and NADH showed the best multi-targeting profile, thus potentially reducing the emergence of resistant virus strains. We also focused on potentially novel pharmacological targets for the development of compounds with anti-pan coronavirus activity. Through the analysis of a large set of viral genomic sequences, the current review provides a comprehensive and specific map of conserved regions across human coronavirus proteins which are essential for virus replication and thus with no or very limited tendency to mutate. Hence, these represent key druggable targets for novel compounds against this virus family. In this respect, the identification of highly effective and innovative pharmacological strategies is of paramount importance for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the current pandemic but potentially also for future and unavoidable outbreaks of human pathogenic coronaviruses.\",\"To affect the COVID-19 pandemic, lifesaving antiviral therapies must be identified. The number of clinical trials that can be performed is limited. We developed mathematical models to project multiple therapeutic approaches. Our models recapitulate off-treatment viral dynamics and predict a three-phase immune response. Simulated treatment with remdesivir, selinexor, neutralizing antibodies, or cellular immunotherapy demonstrates that rapid viral elimination is possible if in vivo potency is sufficiently high. Therapies dosed soon after peak viral load when symptoms develop may decrease shedding duration and immune response intensity but have little effect on viral area under the curve (AUC), which is driven by high early viral loads. Potent therapy dosed before viral peak during presymptomatic infection could lower AUC. Drug resistance may emerge with a moderately potent agent dosed before viral peak. Our results support early treatment for COVID-19 if shedding duration, not AUC, is most predictive of clinical severity.\",\"Intestinal permeability is a critical factor for orally administered drugs. It can be facilitated by uptake transporters or limited by efflux transporters and metabolic enzymes in the intestine. The present study aimed to characterize the Ussing chamber system incorporating human intestinal tissue as an in vitro model for investigating the impact of intestinal uptake/efflux transporters on the intestinal absorption of substrate drugs in humans. We confirmed the functions of major intestinal uptake/efflux drug transporters in freshly isolated human jejunum sections by demonstrating a significant decrease in the mucosal uptake of cefadroxil (peptide transporter 1) and methotrexate (proton-coupled folate transporter), mucosal-to-serosal permeability of ribavirin (concentrative nucleoside transporters/equilibrative nucleoside transporters), and serosal-to-mucosal permeability of P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein substrates in the presence of their typical inhibitors. The mucosal-to-serosal apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) of 19 drugs, including substrates of drug transporters and cytochrome P450 3A, ranged from 0.60 \\u00d7 10[-6] to 29 \\u00d7 10[-6] cm/s and showed a good correlation with reported fraction of an oral dose that enters the gut wall and passes into the portal circulation with escaping intestinal metabolism (FaFg) values in humans. Furthermore, the Papp values for cefadroxil, methotrexate, and ribavirin in the presence of the corresponding transporter inhibitors underestimated the FaFg of these drugs, which clearly showed that intestinal uptake transporters facilitate their intestinal absorption in humans. In conclusion, the functions of major intestinal uptake/efflux drug transporters could be maintained in freshly isolated human jejunum sections. The Ussing chamber system incorporating human intestinal tissue would be useful for evaluating the impact of intestinal uptake/efflux transporters on the intestinal absorption of various types of drugs in humans. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Although previous studies have predicted the intestinal absorption of drugs in humans using the Ussing chamber system incorporating human intestinal tissue, there is little systematic information about drug transport mediated by multiple transporters in this system. We confirmed the functions of major intestinal uptake/efflux transporters in freshly isolated human jejunum sections and demonstrated that the mucosal-to-serosal apparent permeability coefficient of various types of drugs showed a good correlation with reported human FaFg values.\",\"To assess the efficacy of several repurposed drugs to prevent hospitalisation or death in patients aged 65 or more with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and no criteria for hospitalisation.\",\"Two antiviral classes, the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) and polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir) can be used to prevent and treat influenza infections during seasonal epidemics and pandemics. However, prolonged treatment may lead to the emergence of drug resistance. Therapeutic combinations constitute an alternative to prevent resistance and reduce antiviral doses. Therefore, we evaluated in vitro combinations of baloxavir acid (BXA) and other approved drugs against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) subtypes. The determination of an effective concentration inhibiting virus cytopathic effects by 50% (EC50) for each drug and combination indexes (CIs) were based on cell viability. CompuSyn software was used to determine synergism, additivity or antagonism between drugs. Combinations of BXA and NAIs or favipiravir had synergistic effects on cell viability against the two influenza A subtypes. Those effects were confirmed using a physiological and predictive ex vivo reconstructed human airway epithelium model. On the other hand, the combination of BXA and ribavirin showed mixed results. Overall, BXA stands as a good candidate for combination with several existing drugs, notably oseltamivir and favipiravir, to improve in vitro antiviral activity. These results should be considered for further animal and clinical evaluations.\",\"Honeysuckle has been used in the treatment of influenza virus infection for thousands of years in China. However, its main active components and the functional mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, four honeysuckle extracts, including acids extract, flavonoids extract, total extract and acids-flavonoids mixture, were prepared to clarify the main active antiviral components. The cytopathic effect reduction assay showed that all the four extracts inhibited the replication of influenza viruses H1N1, H3N2 and the oseltamivir-resistant mutant strain H1N1-H275Y. The acids-flavonoids mixture had the strongest inhibitory effects in vitro with EC50 values of 3.8, 4.1, and > 20 \\u03bcg/mL against H1N1, H3N2 and H1N1-H275Y, respectively, showing competitive antiviral activity with oseltamivir and ribavirin. Honeysuckle acids extract also showed the most significant antiviral activity in vivo. Oral administration of the acids extract at a dosage of 600 mg/kg/d effectively alleviated viral pneumonia, maintained body weight and improved the survival rate to 30% of the mice infected with a lethal dose of H1N1. The results of time-of-drug addition experiment and neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay showed that honeysuckle extracts had a broad-spectrum inhibitory effect against influenza virus NAs. The flavonoid extract showed the strongest inhibitory effect on the NA of influenza virus H7N9 with an IC50 of 24.7 \\u03bcg/mL. These results suggested that these extracts might exert their antiviral activity by suppressing the release of influenza viruses. Briefly, our findings demonstrate that acids and flavonoids extracts of honeysuckle are the major antiviral active components, and the acids extract has the potential to be developed into an antiviral agent against influenza virus, especially for oseltamivir-resistant viruses.\",\"Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug that has been clinically evaluated in Ebola virus patients and recently received emergency use authorization (EUA) for treatment of COVID-19. With approvals from the Federal Select Agent Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Institutional Biosecurity Board, we characterized the resistance profile of remdesivir by serially passaging Ebola virus under remdesivir selection; we generated lineages with low-level reduced susceptibility to remdesivir after 35 passages. We found that a single amino acid substitution, F548S, in the Ebola virus polymerase conferred low-level reduced susceptibility to remdesivir. The F548 residue is highly conserved in filoviruses but should be subject to specific surveillance among novel filoviruses, in newly emerging variants in ongoing outbreaks, and also in Ebola virus patients undergoing remdesivir therapy. Homology modeling suggests that the Ebola virus polymerase F548 residue lies in the F-motif of the polymerase active site, a region that was previously identified as susceptible to resistance mutations in coronaviruses. Our data suggest that molecular surveillance of this region of the polymerase in remdesivir-treated COVID-19 patients is also warranted.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C still figures as an important cause of morbidity among the Brazilian population, and is closely associated with metabolic disturbances, including insulin resistance (IR), which can be evaluated by the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA-IR). IR may entail lower sustained virologic response (SVR) on certain therapeutic regimens and faster progression to advanced hepatic fibrosis. With the arrival of the direct acting agents (DAA) in hepatitis C treatment, there is an increased need in observing the impact in patients' IR profile while using such therapies.\",\"SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for COVID-19, resulting in the largest pandemic in over a hundred years. After examining the molecular structures and activities of hepatitis C viral inhibitors and comparing hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, we previously postulated that the FDA-approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) might inhibit SARS-CoV-2. We subsequently demonstrated that Sofosbuvir triphosphate is incorporated by the relatively low fidelity SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), serving as an immediate polymerase reaction terminator, but not by a host-like high fidelity DNA polymerase. Other investigators have since demonstrated the ability of Sofosbuvir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and brain cells; additionally, COVID-19 clinical trials with EPCLUSA and with Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir have been initiated in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader to maintain the viral genome integrity. Any effective antiviral targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp must display a certain level of resistance to this proofreading activity. We report here that Sofosbuvir terminated RNA resists removal by the exonuclease to a substantially higher extent than RNA terminated by Remdesivir, another drug being used as a COVID-19 therapeutic. These results offer a molecular basis supporting the current use of Sofosbuvir in combination with other drugs in COVID-19 clinical trials.\",\"With the global threat of SARS-CoV-2, much effort has been focused on treatment and disease control. However, how coronaviruses react to the treatments and whether the surviving viruses have altered their characteristics are also unanswered questions with medical importance. To this end, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), which is in the same genus as SARS-CoV-2, was used as a test model and the findings were as follows. With the treatment of antiviral remdesivir, the selected BCoV variant with an altered genome structure developed resistance, but its pathogenicity was not increased in comparison to that of wild type (wt) BCoV. Under the selection pressure of innate immunity, the genome structure was also altered; however, neither resistance developed nor pathogenicity increased for the selected BCoV variant. Furthermore, both selected BCoV variants showed a better efficiency in adapting to alternative host cells than wt BCoV. In addition, the previously unidentified feature that the spike protein was a common target for mutations under different antiviral treatments might pose a problem for vaccine development because spike protein is a common target for antibody and vaccine designs. The findings derived from this fundamental research may contribute to the disease control and treatments against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.\",\"Remdesivir (RDV) is a direct-acting antiviral agent that is used to treat patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RDV targets the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have previously shown that incorporation of the active triphosphate form of RDV (RDV-TP) at position i causes delayed chain termination at position i + 3. Here we demonstrate that the S861G mutation in RdRp eliminates chain termination, which confirms the existence of a steric clash between Ser-861 and the incorporated RDV-TP. With WT RdRp, increasing concentrations of NTP pools cause a gradual decrease in termination and the resulting read-through increases full-length product formation. Hence, RDV residues could be embedded in copies of the first RNA strand that is later used as a template. We show that the efficiency of incorporation of the complementary UTP opposite template RDV is compromised, providing a second opportunity to inhibit replication. A structural model suggests that RDV, when serving as the template for the incoming UTP, is not properly positioned because of a significant clash with Ala-558. The adjacent Val-557 is in direct contact with the template base, and the V557L mutation is implicated in low-level resistance to RDV. We further show that the V557L mutation in RdRp lowers the nucleotide concentration required to bypass this template-dependent inhibition. The collective data provide strong evidence to show that template-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by RDV is biologically relevant.\",\"Plant diseases are seriously endangering agricultural production. The emergence of drug resistance has brought great challenges to the prevention and control of plant diseases. There is an urgent need for the emergence of new drug candidates. In this work, we achieved the efficient synthesis of pulmonarins A and B in 64% and 59% overall yield, respectively. Pulmonarins A and B were found to have good antiviral activities against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) for the first time. A series of pulmonarin derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their antiviral and fungicidal activities systematically. Most compounds displayed higher anti-TMV activities than commercial ribavirin. Compounds 6a, 6c, and 6n with better inactivation effects than ningnanmycin emerged as new antiviral candidates. We selected 6c for further antiviral mechanism research, which revealed that it could inhibit virus assembly by interacting with TMV coat protein (CP). The molecular docking results further confirmed that these compounds could interact with CP through hydrogen bonding. These compounds also displayed broad spectrum fungicidal activities. Especially compound 6u with prominent antifungal activity emerged as a new fungicidal candidate for further research. The current work provides a reference for understanding the application of pulmonarin alkaloids in plant protection.\",\"To evaluate the impact of baseline resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) on direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment response among pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin (PR) failing patients in a real-life setting.\",\"Ribavirin has been used for 25 years to treat patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection; however, its antiviral mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we studied virus evolution in a subset of samples from a randomized 24-week trial of ribavirin monotherapy versus placebo in chronic HCV patients, as well as the viral resistance mechanisms of the observed ribavirin-associated mutations in cell culture. Thus, we performed next-generation sequencing of the full-length coding sequences of HCV recovered from patients at weeks 0, 12, 20, 32 and 40 and analyzed novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), diversity, and mutation-linkage. At week 20, increased genetic diversity was observed in 5 ribavirin-treated compared to 4 placebo-treated HCV patients due to new synonymous SNPs, particularly G-to-A and C-to-U ribavirin-associated transitions. Moreover, emergence of 14 nonsynonymous SNPs in HCV nonstructural 5B (NS5B) occurred in treated patients, but not in placebo controls. Most substitutions located close to the NS5B polymerase nucleotide entry site. Linkage analysis showed that putative resistance mutations were found in the majority of genomes in ribavirin-treated patients. Identified NS5B mutations from genotype 3a patients were further introduced into the genotype 3a cell-culture-adapted DBN strain for studies in Huh7.5 cells. Specific NS5B substitutions, including DBN-D148N+I363V, DBN-A150V+I363V, and DBN-T227S+S183P, conferred resistance to ribavirin in long-term cell culture treatment, possibly by reducing the HCV polymerase error rate. In conclusion, prolonged exposure of HCV to ribavirin in chronic hepatitis C patients induces NS5B resistance mutations leading to increased polymerase fidelity, which could be one mechanism for ribavirin resistance.\",\"Induction of highly pathogenic hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes chronic hepatitis round the world. This virus is easily prone to developing resistance against antiviral drugs because of two viral polymerases that do not possess the proofreading and overlapping reading frame abilities. There is more than one explanation for how this virus builds up resistance against antiviral drug treatments. Assays are now available to detect HCV-resistant variants, based on phenotypic and genotypic assays, and next generation sequencing. But these assays are of a little value at baseline, because they are not influential enough for making therapeutic decisions in HCV patients. Moreover, HCV monitoring is now an essential part of clinical practice. Special patients, such as those with thalassemia, renal transplant due to renal failure, and the patients undergoing hemodialysis, are at higher risk for acquiring this infection. Management of HCV infection in these patient groups is complicated by multiple side effects, including flu-like symptoms, neutropenia, fever, and neuropsychiatric disorders, thus limiting the use of ribavirin and coexisting iron overload. In HCV patients suffering from depression, the treatment may be discontinued because of some defects in neurochemical pathways caused by interferon, which can enhance the level of depression in these patients. In addition, obesity has been found to be a marker of failure of HCV treatment. There will be many resistance tolerant HCV treatment options available in the near future.\",\"Obese patients who often present metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) are at risk of severe presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These patients are more likely to be hospitalized and receive antiviral agents and other drugs required to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic inflammation, combat bacterial and fungal superinfections and reverse multi-organ failure. Among these pharmaceuticals, antiretrovirals such as lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir, antibiotics and antifungal agents can induce drug-induced liver injury (DILI), whose mechanisms are not always understood. In the present article, we hypothesize that obese COVID-19 patients with MAFLD might be at higher risk for DILI than non-infected healthy individuals or MAFLD patients. These patients present several concomitant factors, which individually can favour DILI: polypharmacy, systemic inflammation at risk of cytokine storm, fatty liver and sometimes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) as well as insulin resistance and other diseases linked to obesity. Hence, in obese COVID-19 patients, some drugs might cause more severe (and/or more frequent) DILI, while others might trigger the transition of fatty liver to NASH, or worsen pre-existing steatosis, necroinflammation and fibrosis. We also present the main mechanisms whereby drugs can be more hepatotoxic in MAFLD including impaired activity of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered lipid homeostasis and oxidative stress. Although comprehensive investigations are needed to confirm our hypothesis, we believe that the current epidemic of obesity and related metabolic diseases has extensively contributed to increase the number of cases of DILI in COVID-19 patients, which may have participated in presentation severity and death.\",\"This is the ninth version (eighth update) of the living guideline, replacing earlier versions, available as data supplements. New recommendations will be published as updates to this guideline.\",\"Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses carrying a dual neuraminidase (NA) substitution were isolated from immunocompromised patients after administration of one or more NA inhibitors. These mutant viruses possessed an H275Y/I223R, H275Y/I223K, or H275Y/G147R substitution in their NA and showed enhanced cross-resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir and reduced susceptibility to zanamivir compared to single H275Y mutant viruses. Baloxavir could be a treatment option against the multidrug-resistant viruses because these dual H275Y mutant viruses showed susceptibility to this drug. The G147R substitution appears to stabilize the NA structure, with the fitness of the H275Y/G147R mutant virus being similar or somewhat better than that of the wild-type virus. Since the multidrug-resistant viruses may be able to transmit between humans, surveillance of these viruses must continue to improve clinical management and to protect public health.\",\"Oxidative stress (OS) and insulin resistance (IR) induced by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, are involved in the development of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) complications and progression to hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pegylated interferon alpha (IFN\\u03b1) + ribavirin (PegIFN\\u03b1+RVB) or sofosbuvir + NS5A inhibitor (SOF+InNS5A) on IR and the components of OS. HCV was genotyped in 20 CHC patients grouped by treatment with either PegIFN\\u03b1+RVB (n = 10) or SOF+InNS5A (n = 10). The treatment's effect on OS-induced damage to lipids (HNE-HDL), proteins (advanced glycation end products [AGEs]), and DNA (8-OHdG) as well as the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2, TNF\\u03b1, IFN\\u03b3), ALT, AST, GSH and platelets was determined. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity as well as IR, determined by the HOMA1-IR index, was evaluated. The HCV genotypes (GT) found were GT1b (45%), GT1a (30%), GT2b (20%), and GT2a (5%). Viral RNA became undetectable by week 12 with SOF+InNS5A in 100% of the cases and with PegIFN\\u03b1+RVB in 70% of the cases. After viral RNA became undetectable, regardless of treatment and GT, a significant increase in the platelet concentration and SOD activity was observed, whereas ALT, insulin, and IR decreased (p < 0.05). However, only for the SOF+InNS5A treated group was there an increase in oxidative damage to lipids (p < 0.017) and proteins (p < 0.05). None of the other parameters demonstrated any differences. These data confirm that OS persisted after treatment with either SOF+InNS5A or PegIFN\\u03b1+RVB. IR could be considered a response biomarker to treatment with direct-acting antivirals.\",\"The aim of our study was to evaluate the association between insulin resistance and the response to IFN-alpha and ribavirin in pediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C.\",\"We aimed to clarify the features of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) after failure of multiple interferon (IFN)-free regimens in HCV genotype 1b infections.\",\"New therapeutic options are urgently needed to tackle the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals provides an immediate treatment opportunity. We assessed the efficacy of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with ribavirin for treating patients with COVID-19.\",\"To evaluate the effect of generic sofosbuvir and daclatasvir (SOF/DCV) treatment on the glycemic state and insulin resistance as well as lipid profiles of those who achieved sustained virological response (SVR) in diabetic chronic hepatitis C virus (CHC) patients.\",\"On June 8, 2018, an NS3/4A protease inhibitor called danoprevir was approved in China to treat the infections of HCV genotype (GT) 1b - the most common HCV genotype worldwide. Based on phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, the 12-week regimen of ritonavir-boosted danoprevir (danoprevir/r) plus peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin offered 97.1% (200/206) of sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) in treatment-na\\u00efve non-cirrhotic patients infected with HCV genotype 1b. Adverse events such as anemia, fatigue, fever, and headache were associated with the inclusion of peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin in the danoprevir-based regimen. Moreover, drug resistance to danoprevir could be traced to amino acid substitutions (Q80K/R, R155K, D168A/E/H/N/T/V) near the drug-binding pocket of HCV NS3 protease. Despite its approval, the clinical use of danoprevir is currently limited to its combination with peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin, thereby driving its development towards interferon-free, ribavirin-free regimens with improved tolerability and adherence. In the foreseeable future, pan-genotypic direct-acting antivirals with better clinical efficacy and less adverse events will be available to treat HCV infections worldwide.\",\"Alphaviruses are arthropod-borne viruses of public health concern. To date no efficient vaccine nor antivirals are available for safe human use. During viral replication the nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1) catalyzes capping of genomic and subgenomic RNAs. The capping reaction is unique to the Alphavirus genus. The whole three-step process follows a particular order: (i) transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) onto a GTP forming [m7]GTP; (ii) guanylylation of the enzyme to form a [m7]GMP-nsP1adduct; (iii) transfer of [m7]GMP onto 5'-diphosphate RNA to yield capped RNA. Specificities of these reactions designate nsP1 as a promising target for antiviral drug development. In the current study we performed a mutational analysis on two nsP1 positions associated with Sindbis virus (SINV) ribavirin resistance in the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) context through reverse genetics correlated to enzyme assays using purified recombinant VEEV nsP1 proteins. The results demonstrate that the targeted positions are strongly associated to the regulation of the capping reaction by increasing the affinity between GTP and nsP1. Data also show that in VEEV the S21A substitution, naturally occurring in Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), is a hallmark of ribavirin susceptibility. These findings uncover the specific mechanistic contributions of these residues to nsp1-mediated methyl-transfer and guanylylation reactions.\",\"Viral diversity is an important feature of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and an important predictor of disease progression and treatment response. HIV/HCV co-infection is associated with enhanced HCV replication, increased fibrosis, and the development of liver disease. HIV also increases quasispecies diversity of HCV structural genes, although limited data are available regarding the impact of HIV on non-structural genes of HCV, particularly in the absence of direct-acting therapies. The genetic diversity and presence of drug resistance mutations within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) gene were examined in 3 groups of women with HCV genotype 1a infection, including those with HCV mono-infection, antiretroviral (ART)-na\\u00efve women with HIV/HCV co-infection and CD4 cell count <350 cells/mm3, and ART-na\\u00efve women with HIV/HCV co-infection and CD4 cell count \\u2265350 cells/mm3. None had ever been treated for HCV infection. There was evidence of significant diversity across the entire NS5B gene in all women. There were several nucleotides and amino acids with distinct distributions across the three study groups, although no obvious clustering of NS5B sequences was observed based on HIV co-infection or CD4 cell count. Polymorphisms at amino acid positions associated with resistance to dasabuvir and sofosbuvir were limited, although the Q309R variant associated with ribavirin resistance was present in 12 individuals with HCV mono-infection, 8 HIV/HCV co-infected individuals with CD4 <350 cells/mm3, and 12 HIV/HCV co-infected individuals with CD4 \\u2265350 cells/mm3. Previously reported fitness altering mutations were rare. CD8+ T cell responses against the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B57-restricted epitopes NS5B2629-2637 and NS5B2936-2944 are critical for HCV control and were completely conserved in 44 (51.8%) and 70 (82.4%) study participants. These data demonstrate extensive variation across the NS5B gene. Genotypic variation may have a profound impact on HCV replication and pathogenesis and deserves careful evaluation.\",\"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) may be resistant to immunosuppression reduction and ribavirin treatment in kidney transplant recipients because of mutant strains and severe side effects of ribavirin which conduct to dose reduction. Sofosbuvir efficacy is controversial. Peg-interferon 2 alpha (PEG-IFN) is currently contraindicated due to a high risk of acute humoral and cellular rejection. The present study assessed, for the first time, the effect of PEG-IFN in a kidney transplant recipient infected with HEV.\",\"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A-P32 deletion (P32del) confers potent resistance to NS5A inhibitors. Chronic hepatitis C patients in whom NS5A-P32del variants had emerged during prior direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy with an NS5A inhibitor show poor response to DAA retreatment. Here, we report three patients with HCV NS5A-P32del infection who were treated with sofosbuvir, velpatasvir plus ribavirin (SOF/VEL + RBV) in a real-world setting. The patients developed HCV NS5A-P32del, L31F + P32del, or L31V + P32del variants following failure of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir (DCV/ASV) therapy. One of the patients failed to respond to subsequent DCV/ASV and beclabuvir therapy, and the remaining two patients failed to respond to subsequent glecaprevir and pibrentasvir therapy. All three patients completed 24-week SOF/VEL + RBV therapy. Serum HCV RNA became negative at the end of the therapy in all three patients. Two patients with NS5A-P32del and NS5A-L31F + P32del achieved sustained virological response 12 weeks after completion of treatment (SVR12), but HCV relapsed in the remaining NS5A-L13V + P32del patient. Direct sequence analysis detected no additional variants within either the NS5A or NS5B regions at the time of relapse. In conclusion, three patients with prior NS5A-P32del-associated DAA treatment failure received 24 weeks of SOF/VEL + RBV therapy, and two of the patients achieved SVR12.\",\"Plant diseases caused by plant viruses and pathogens seriously affect the production and storage of food crops. With the emergence of drug resistance, it is very difficult to control. Natural products are the source of new drug discovery. Here, the natural product streptindole was found to have good antiviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and fungicidal activities against 14 kinds of phytopathogenic fungi. A series of derivatives of streptindole were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their antiviral and fungicidal activities. Compounds 4, 5, 11, 12c, 12d, 13d, and 13i-13l showed higher anti-TMV activities than ribavirin (inhibitory rate: 38, 37, and 40% at 500 \\u03bcg/mL for inactivation, curative, and protection activity in vivo, respectively), among which compound 12d (inhibitory rate: 57, 55, and 53% at 500 \\u03bcg/mL for inactivation, curative, and protection activity in vivo, respectively) with excellent antiviral activity was further evaluated for the mode of action. The mechanism research revealed that 12d can break the three-dimensional structure of TMV coat protein (CP) through hydrogen bonds, thus inhibiting the assembly of virus particles. The molecular docking result showed that compound 12d did exhibit strong interaction with TMV CP. The derivatives of streptindole also displayed broad-spectrum fungicidal activities. The current study provided valuable insights into the antiviral and fungicidal activities of streptindole derivatives.\",\"The combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) has been approved for the treatment of various hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes across many countries. This article presents an integrated analysis of three prospective phase II/III trials in the Asia-Pacific region to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of LDV/SOF in HCV genotype 2 patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.\",\"During the last decade multiple mumps outbreaks have occurred in the U.S. despite high two dose MMR coverage with most cases detected among two dose MMR vaccine recipients. Waning immunity, the evolution of wild-type virus strains, and settings with intense exposure have contributed to the resurgence of mumps. Typically, mumps virus infections resolve without serious clinical sequelae; however, serious complications may occur among unvaccinated or severely immunocompromised individuals. Favipiravir (T-705) has been shown to have in vitro anti-viral activity against a broad range of positive and negative strand RNA viruses. Here, we demonstrate that T-705 inhibits the growth of wildtype and vaccine strains of mumps virus in vitro at low micro-molar concentrations (EC50 8-10\\u03bcM). We did not observe the development of resistance after five subsequent passages at low concentrations of drug. Both viral RNA and protein synthesis were selectively reduced compared to host mRNA and protein synthesis. Antiviral treatment options for mumps virus infection may be valuable, especially for areas with a high disease burden or for cases with severe complications. These results presented here suggest that further studies are warranted.\",\"Picornaviruses have both asexual and sexual RNA replication mechanisms. Asexual RNA replication mechanisms involve one parental template, whereas sexual RNA replication mechanisms involve two or more parental templates. Because sexual RNA replication mechanisms counteract ribavirin-induced error catastrophe, we selected for ribavirin-resistant poliovirus to identify polymerase residues that facilitate sexual RNA replication mechanisms. We used serial passage in ribavirin, beginning with a variety of ribavirin-sensitive and ribavirin-resistant parental viruses. Ribavirin-sensitive virus contained an L420A polymerase mutation, while ribavirin-resistant virus contained a G64S polymerase mutation. A G64 codon mutation (G64[Fix]) was used to inhibit emergence of G64S-mediated ribavirin resistance. Revertants (L420) or pseudorevertants (L420V and L420I) were selected from all independent lineages of L420A, G64[Fix] L420A, and G64S L420A parental viruses. Ribavirin resistance G64S mutations were selected in two independent lineages, and novel ribavirin resistance mutations were selected in the polymerase in other lineages (M299I, M323I, M392V, and T353I). The structural orientation of M392, immediately adjacent to L420 and the polymerase primer grip region, led us to engineer additional polymerase mutations into poliovirus (M392A, M392L, M392V, K375R, and R376K). L420A revertants and pseudorevertants (L420V and L420I) restored efficient viral RNA recombination, confirming that ribavirin-induced error catastrophe coincides with defects in sexual RNA replication mechanisms. Viruses containing M392 mutations (M392A, M392L, and M392V) and primer grip mutations (K375R and R376K) exhibited divergent RNA recombination, ribavirin sensitivity, and biochemical phenotypes, consistent with changes in the fidelity of RNA synthesis. We conclude that an extended primer grip of the polymerase, including L420, M392, K375, and R376, contributes to the fidelity of RNA synthesis and to efficient sexual RNA replication mechanisms.IMPORTANCE Picornaviruses have both asexual and sexual RNA replication mechanisms. Sexual RNA replication shapes picornavirus species groups, contributes to the emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses, and counteracts error catastrophe. Can viruses distinguish between homologous and nonhomologous partners during sexual RNA replication? We implicate an extended primer grip of the viral polymerase in sexual RNA replication mechanisms. By sensing RNA sequence complementarity near the active site, the extended primer grip of the polymerase has the potential to distinguish between homologous and nonhomologous RNA templates during sexual RNA replication.\",\"Starting from late 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a once-in-a-century pandemic with deadly consequences, which urgently calls for new treatments, cures, and supporting apparatuses. Recently, because of its positive results in clinical trials, remdesivir was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 through Emergency Use Authorization. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We first constructed the homology model of this polymerase based on a previously available structure of SARS-CoV NSP12 RdRp (with a sequence identity of 95.8%). We then built a putative preinsertion binding structure by aligning the remdesivir + RdRp complex to the ATP bound poliovirus RdRp without the RNA template. The putative binding structure was further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting stable preinsertion state of remdesivir appeared to form hydrogen bonds with the RNA template when aligned with the newly solved cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The relative binding free energy between remdesivir and ATP was calculated to be -2.80 \\u00b1 0.84 kcal/mol, where remdesivir bound much stronger to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp than the natural substrate ATP. The \\u223c100-fold improvement in the Kd from remdesivir over ATP indicates an effective replacement of ATP in blocking of the RdRp preinsertion site. Key residues D618, S549, and R555 are found to be the contributors to the binding affinity of remdesivir. These findings suggest that remdesivir can potentially act as a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-chain terminator, effectively stopping its RNA replication, with key residues also identified for future lead optimization and/or drug resistance studies.\",\"In previous studies that investigated the impact of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment on lipid metabolism and insulin resistance in chronic hepatitis C patients have been compared to baseline values with either end of treatment or post-treatment values. The results are inconsistent. We evaluated patients throughout the treatment and after treatment.\",\"COVID-19, the illness caused by infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a rapidly spreading global pandemic in urgent need of effective treatments. Here we present a comprehensive examination of the host- and virus-targeted functions of the flavonolignan silibinin, a potential drug candidate against COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2. As a direct inhibitor of STAT3-a master checkpoint regulator of inflammatory cytokine signaling and immune response-silibinin might be expected to phenotypically integrate the mechanisms of action of IL-6-targeted monoclonal antibodies and pan-JAK1/2 inhibitors to limit the cytokine storm and T-cell lymphopenia in the clinical setting of severe COVID-19. As a computationally predicted, remdesivir-like inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-the central component of the replication/transcription machinery of SARS-CoV-2-silibinin is expected to reduce viral load and impede delayed interferon responses. The dual ability of silibinin to target both the host cytokine storm and the virus replication machinery provides a strong rationale for the clinical testing of silibinin against the COVID-19 global public health emergency. A randomized, open-label, phase II multicentric clinical trial (SIL-COVID19) will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of silibinin in the prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome in moderate-to-severe COVID-19-positive onco-hematological patients at the Catalan Institute of Oncology in Catalonia, Spain.\",\"Effective therapies to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed. While many investigational, approved, and repurposed drugs have been suggested as potential treatments, preclinical data from animal models can guide the search for effective treatments by ruling out those that lack efficacy in vivo. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a nucleotide analogue prodrug with broad antiviral activity[1,2] that is currently being investigated in COVID-19 clinical trials and recently received Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration[3,4]. In animal models, remdesivir was effective against infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)[2,5,6]. In vitro, remdesivir inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-2[7,8]. Here we investigate the efficacy of remdesivir in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection[9]. Unlike vehicle-treated animals, macaques treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease; they also showed reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs and reduced virus titres in bronchoalveolar lavages twelve hours after the first dose. Virus shedding from the upper respiratory tract was not reduced by remdesivir treatment. At necropsy, remdesivir-treated animals had lower lung viral loads and reduced lung damage. Thus, treatment with remdesivir initiated early during infection had a clinical benefit in rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although the rhesus macaque model does not represent the severe disease observed in some patients with COVID-19, our data support the early initiation of remdesivir treatment in patients with COVID-19 to prevent progression to pneumonia.\",\"No information exists regarding direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) salvage therapy for Hepatitis C (HCV)-infected patients with any type of cancer. We prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy (SVR12) of salvage therapy in these patients.\",\"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). While no drugs have yet been approved to treat this disease, small molecules effective against other viral infections are under clinical evaluation for therapeutic abatement of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Ongoing clinical trials include Kaletra (a combination of two protease inhibitors approved for HIV treatment), remdesivir (an investigational drug targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRP] of SARS-CoV-2), and hydroxychloroquine (an approved anti-malarial and immuno-modulatory drug). Since SARS-CoV-2 replication depends on three virally encoded proteins (RdRP, papain-like proteinase, and helicase), we screened 54 FDA-approved antiviral drugs and ~3300 investigational drugs for binding to these proteins using targeted and unbiased docking simulations and computational modeling. Elbasvir, a drug approved for treating hepatitis C, is predicted to bind stably and preferentially to all three proteins. At the therapeutic dosage, elbasvir has low toxicity (liver enzymes transiently elevated in 1% of subjects) and well-characterized drug-drug interactions. We predict that treatment with elbasvir, alone or in combination with other drugs such as grazoprevir, could efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 replication. The concerted action of elbasvir on at least three targets essential for viral replication renders viral mutation to drug resistance extremely unlikely.\",\"Highly effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for Hepatitis C treatment are largely inaccessible in sub-Saharan Africa. Data on treatment feasibility and outcomes in clinical settings are limited. We assessed the feasibility of achieving a high (\\u226590%) cure rate with DAAs in six gastroenterology clinics in Cameroon.\",\"Background: In the United States, the number of new cases of hepatitis C virus infection has risen in recent years, driven largely by transmission among young white adults in their 20s and 30s. Herein, we report an integrated analysis of participants with hepatitis C virus infection aged \\u226435 years from 12 phase II/III clinical trials of elbasvir/grazoprevir.Methods: Treatment-naive and -experienced adults with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 or 4 infection received elbasvir (50 mg/day)/grazoprevir (100 mg/day) for 12 weeks without ribavirin. Analyses were stratified according to participant age (\\u226435 years vs >35 years). The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (hepatitis C virus RNA < lower limit of quantitation at 12 weeks after completion of therapy).Results: Sustained virologic response was achieved by 98.9% (271/274) of participants aged \\u226435 years and by 96.9% (2093/2160) aged >35 years. Three participants aged \\u226435 years with genotype 1b infection relapsed. Eight participants with genotype 1a infection and baseline non-structural protein 5 A resistance-associated substitutions achieved sustained virologic response. Similarly, all 85 participants aged \\u226435 years with genotype 1a infection and no baseline non-structural protein 5 A resistance-associated substitutions achieved sustained virologic response. Safety was favorable, with the incidence of drug-related adverse events similar in younger and older participants (30.1% vs 30.6%). One participant (0.4%) aged \\u226435 years and 15 participants (0.7%) aged >35 years discontinued treatment owing to adverse events.Conclusions: Elbasvir/grazoprevir for 12 weeks was safe and highly effective in participants aged \\u226435 years with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 or 4 infection.\",\"Background: Despite the outstanding results of direct-acting antiviral therapies (DAAs) of Hepatitis C infection (HCV), non-responders had to be more defined. Aim: assess the outcome of DAAs in linkage with Interferon lambda 3 (IFNL3) in HCV patients. Methods: This case-control-study was conducted on 495 chronic-HCV (genotype-4a), previously treated Egyptians by either DAAs (responders 195, 120 relapsers) or interferon/ribavirin (IFN/RBV) (140 responders, 60 relapsers), and 98 healthy controls. IFNL3 distribution, clinical and laboratory data were assessed. Results: CT was the most predominant genotype in Egyptians (51%). All genotypes were sensitive to DAAs mainly CT genotype (60%), even TT genotype (resistant to IFN/RBV 40%) had 29.2% sensitivity. CT genotype was predominant in sofosbuvir/Daclatasvir responders (67.6%) (OR = 0.66), while non-CT prevailed in relapsers (56.7%). TT genotype may respond to SOF/Ledi better than other regimens (66.7%). In IFN/RBV relapsers; CT genotype was commoner (50%) than others, while CC genotype predominated in responders (54.3%). The c allele was the commonest in responders to IFN/RBV (71.4%), while the T allele was resistant to treatment (65% in relapsers). Addition of RBV to SOF/DCV reported higher resistance with CT genotype (42.2%-50%) and TT genotype (17.8%-27.8%). Conclusion: This study recommended IFNL3 genotyping to be a prerequisite before stratifying treatment for HCV-4a Egyptians.\",\"Relapses after therapy with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are rare due to high efficacy of interferon-free therapy regimens. The presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) in proteins targeted by therapy can lead to lower rates of sustained virological response (SVR) in patients receiving DAA-therapy, and little evidence exists as to how to treat these patients.\",\"Many studies have been performed to develop an antiviral therapy against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. The usual treatment for HCV infection is a combination of PEGylated interferon and ribavirin which offer restricted efficiency and major side effects. Thus, recent development in molecular biology of HCV and its life cycle led to the design of many drugs that target viral proteins and host factors required for viral replication. These drugs were named as direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that were specifically designed for inhibition of viral life cycle, promising tolerability, short duration of treatment, higher barrier to resistance, and fewer drug interactions. The use of DAAs for the treatment of HCV infection resulted in high virological cure rates in patients. However, the use of combined DAA regimens may present drug interactions especially in patients under treatment for other co-morbidities. On the other hand, drug resistance against virus infection determines the success of long-term therapy. High genetic diversity among HCV virions due to error-prone polymerase activity led to the reduced susceptibility to DAA-therapy. Therefore, preclinical and clinical analysis of HCV resistance to novel drugs is needed. In this review, we describe pharmaceutical approaches for HCV treatment, structural and functional properties of DAAs, the principles of HCV drug-drug interaction, and finally HCV resistance to DAAs.\",\"Genotype 1b is the most common HCV genotype worldwide, accounting for the largest proportion of infections in Europe, Russia, Latin America and Asia. Reducing treatment duration can improve adherence, reduce drug exposure and cost. Accordingly, we evaluated the efficacy of 8 weeks fixed-dose combination of grazoprevir-elbasvir in treatment-na\\u00efve patients, with non-severe fibrosis.\",\"For treatment of genotype 1a (GT1a) infection with elbasvir/grazoprevir, the German guidelines recommend a differentiated approach depending on baseline viral load (BVL). For low BVL \\u2264800 000 IU/mL, treatment with 12 weeks elbasvir/grazoprevir should be considered, whereas for high BVL >800 000 IU/mL, this regimen is only recommended in nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) absence. With present NS5A RAS or when RAS-testing is not available, 16 weeks elbasvir/grazoprevir + ribavirin is preferred. Here, we investigated the adherence to these recommendations and the effectiveness of elbasvir/grazoprevir in a large German Hepatitis C-Registry GT1a cohort.\",\"The rapid global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has been the cause of significant health concern, highlighting the immediate need for antivirals. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) play essential roles in viral RNA synthesis, and thus remains the target of choice for the prophylactic or curative treatment of several viral diseases, due to high sequence and structural conservation. To date, the most promising broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues (NAs), with over 25 approved for the treatment of several medically important viral diseases. However, Coronaviruses stand out as a particularly challenging case for NA drug design due to the presence of an exonuclease (ExoN) domain capable of excising incorporated NAs and thus providing resistance to many of these available antivirals. Here we use the available structures of the SARS-CoV RdRp and ExoN proteins, as well as Lassa virus N exonuclease to derive models of catalytically competent SARS-CoV-2 enzymes. We then map a promising NA candidate, GS-441524 (the active metabolite of Remdesivir) to the nucleoside active site of both proteins, identifying the residues important for nucleotide recognition, discrimination, and excision. Interestingly, GS-441524 addresses both enzyme active sites in a manner consistent with significant incorporation, delayed chain termination, and altered excision due to the ribose 1'-CN group, which may account for the increased antiviral effect compared to other available analogues. Additionally, we propose structural and function implications of two previously identified RdRp resistance mutations in relation to resistance against Remdesivir. This study highlights the importance of considering the balance between incorporation and excision properties of NAs between the RdRp and ExoN.\",\"Coronaviruses (CoVs) traffic frequently between species resulting in novel disease outbreaks, most recently exemplified by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Here, we show that the ribonucleoside analog \\u03b2-d-N[4]-hydroxycytidine (NHC; EIDD-1931) has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and related zoonotic group 2b or 2c bat-CoVs, as well as increased potency against a CoV bearing resistance mutations to the nucleoside analog inhibitor remdesivir. In mice infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable NHC prodrug (\\u03b2-d-N[4]-hydroxycytidine-5'-isopropyl ester), improved pulmonary function and reduced virus titer and body weight loss. Decreased MERS-CoV yields in vitro and in vivo were associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral, but not host cell RNA, supporting a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis in CoV. The potency of NHC/EIDD-2801 against multiple CoVs and oral bioavailability highlights its potential utility as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and other future zoonotic CoVs.\",\"Introduction: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a reemerging human arthropod borne virus, can causes global epidemic outbreaks and has become a serious health concern due to the unavailability of any antiviral therapy/vaccine. Extensive research has been conducted to target different proteins from CHIKV to curtail the spread of virus.Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the granted patents including the current status of antiviral strategies targeting CHIKV.Expert opinion: Under the current scenario, potential molecules and different approaches have been utilized to suppress CHIKV infection. MV-CHIKV and VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP vaccine candidates have successfully completed phase I clinical trials and ribavirin (inhibitor) has shown significant inhibition of CHIKV replication and could be the most promising candidates. The drug resistance and toxicity can be modulated by using the inhibitors/drugs in combination. Moreover, nanoparticle formulations can improve the efficacy and bioavailability of drugs.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment with first generation protease inhibitors (PI) + peg-interferon (pegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV) achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of 65-75% but was associated with multiple side effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate safety and efficacy of Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/Ritonavir and Dasabuvir (3D) \\u00b1 RBV in HCV genotype 1 patients that failed previous treatment with first generation PIs.\",\"High-fat diet (HFD) is a predisposing factor for metabolic syndrome-related systemic inflammation and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, there is still no effective therapeutic treatment for NAFLD. Here, we showed that remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734), as a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug with anti-inflammatory effects, was effective for attenuating HFD-induced metabolic disorder and insulin resistance. Results revealed that the liver weight, hepatic dysfunction and lipid accumulation were markedly increased compared with that of the Control group, while that of the RDV group exhibited significant reduction, accompanied by the improved signaling pathway regulating fatty acid metabolism. In agreement with reduced lipid deposition, RDV supplementation suppressed the systematic and hepatic inflammation, as evidenced by reduction of inflammatory cytokines and the blockage of nuclear factor \\u03baB (NF-\\u03baB) signaling. In addition, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and its down-streaming factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) were greatly increased in livers of HFD-fed mice, which were considerably restrained by RDV treatment. The in vitro analysis suggested that RDV functioned as an inhibitor of STING, contributing to the suppression of dyslipidemia and inflammation induced by palmitate (PA). However, PA-triggered lipid deposition and inflammatory response was further accelerated in hepatocytes with STING over-expression. Notably, RDV-attenuated lipid disorder and inflammation were significantly abrogated by the over-expression of STING in PA-stimulated hepatocytes. Taken together, these findings indicated that RDV exhibited protective effects against NAFLD development mainly through repressing STING signaling, and thus could be considered as a potential therapeutic strategy.\",\"The emergence of resistant mutants to the wildly used neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) makes the development of novel drugs necessary. Favipiravir (T-705) is one of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors developed in recent years. To examine the efficacy of T-705 against influenza B virus infections in vivo, C57BL/6 mice infected with wild-type or oseltamivir-resistant influenza B/Memphis/20/96 viruses were treated with T-705. Starting 2 h post inoculation (hpi), T-705 was orally administered to mice BID at dosages of 50, 150, or 300 mg/kg/day for 5 days. Oseltamivir was used as control. Here, we showed that T-705 protected mice from lethal infection in a dose-dependent manner. T-705 administration also significantly reduced viral loads and suppressed pulmonary pathology. In addition, phenotypic assays demonstrated that no T-705-resistant viruses emerged after T-705 treatment. In conclusion, T-705 can be effective to protect mice from lethal infection with both wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant influenza B viruses.\",\"The influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is highly conserved among influenza A, B, C, and D viruses. It comprises three subunits: polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic protein (PA) in influenza A and B viruses or polymerase 3 protein (P3) in influenza C and D viruses. Because this polymerase is essential for influenza virus replication, it has been considered as a target for antiviral agents. Recently, several polymerase inhibitors that target each subunit have been developed. This review discusses the mechanism of action, antiviral activity, and emergence of resistance to three inhibitors approved for the treatment of influenza or in late-phase clinical trials: the PB1 inhibitor favipiravir, the PB2 inhibitor pimodivir, and the PA inhibitor baloxavir marboxil.\",\"Influenza viruses are a major threat to human health globally. In addition to further improving vaccine prophylaxis, disease management through antiviral therapeutics constitutes an important component of the current intervention strategy to prevent advance to complicated disease and reduce case-fatality rates. Standard-of-care is treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors that prevent viral dissemination. In 2018, the first mechanistically new influenza drug class for the treatment of uncomplicated seasonal influenza in 2 decades was approved for human use. Targeting the PA endonuclease subunit of the viral polymerase complex, this class suppresses viral replication. However, the genetic barrier against viral resistance to both drug classes is low, pre-existing resistance is observed in circulating strains, and resistant viruses are pathogenic and transmit efficiently. Addressing the resistance problem has emerged as an important objective for the development of next-generation influenza virus therapeutics. This review will discuss the status of influenza therapeutics including the endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil after its first year of clinical use and evaluate a subset of direct-acting antiviral candidates in different stages of preclinical and clinical development.\",\"Influenza affects approximately 1 billion individuals each year resulting in between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths. Young children and immunocompromised individuals are at a particularly high risk of severe illness attributable to influenza and these are also the groups of individuals in which reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors is most frequently seen. High levels of resistance emerged with previous adamantane therapy for influenza A and despite no longer being used to treat influenza and therefore lack of selection pressure, high levels of adamantane resistance continue to persist in currently circulating influenza A strains. Resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has remained at low levels to date and the majority of resistance is seen in influenza A H1N1 pdm09 infected immunocompromised individuals receiving oseltamivir but is also seen less frequently with influenza A H3N2 and B. Rarely, resistance is also seen in the immunocompetent. There is evidence to suggest that these resistant strains (particularly H1N1 pdm09) are able to maintain their replicative fitness and transmissibility, although there is no clear evidence that being infected with a resistant strain is associated with a worse clinical outcome. Should neuraminidase inhibitor resistance become more problematic in the future, there are a small number of alternative novel agents within the anti-influenza armoury with different mechanisms of action to neuraminidase inhibitors and therefore potentially effective against neuraminidase inhibitor resistant strains. Limited data from use of novel agents such as baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir, does however show that resistance variants can also emerge in the presence of these drugs.\",\"The interleukin 28B (IL28B) genotype is associated with changes of lipid metabolism in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The association of steatosis with serum levels of adiponectin in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients has also been documented. This study aimed for the evaluation of serum levels of IL28B and adiponectin as well as the association of IL28B SNPs with different clinicopathological parameters in HCV-infected patients.\",\"Presatovir is an oral respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion inhibitor targeting RSV F protein. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy adults experimentally infected with RSV (Memphis-37b), presatovir significantly reduced viral load and clinical disease severity in a dose-dependent manner.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease, with \\u223c71 million chronically infected individuals worldwide. Treatment of patients with HCV-related liver disease has advanced considerably thanks to the development of new direct-acting antiviral drugs that are now administered as highly potent, safe, and well-tolerated combinations with a high barrier to resistance. International organizations, such as the European Association for the Study of the Liver, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases jointly with the Infectious Diseases Society of America, or the World Health Organization have published detailed treatment guidelines. With these therapies becoming more and more widely available, elimination of hepatitis C as a public health threat by 2030 can now be envisaged in several countries. In other regions, better screening, diagnosis, and linkage to care will be necessary to achieve this ambitious goal.\",\"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is an emerging disease in industrialized countries which is usually characterized by a self-limited course. However, there is an increased risk of HEV persistence in immunocompromised risk populations, comprising patients following solid organ transplantation or hematological malignancies. Recently, chronic HEV infection following rituximab-containing treatment regimens has been described. Here we report five patients with chronic hepatitis E after prior rituximab therapy for various indications. We determined the immunological characteristics of these patients and analyzed the development of ribavirin (RBV) treatment failure-associated mutations in the HEV genome. One patient became chronically HEV-infected 110 months after administration of rituximab (RTX). Immunological characterization revealed that all patients exhibited significant hypogammaglobulinemia and CD4+ T cell lymphopenia. One patient permanently cleared HEV following weight-based ribavirin treatment while three patients failed to reach a sustained virological response. In depth mutational analysis confirmed the presence of specific mutations associated with RBV treatment failure in these patients. Our cases indicate that rituximab-containing treatment regimens might imply a relevant risk for persistent HEV infection even years after the last rituximab application. Moreover, we provide further evidence to prior observations suggesting that chronically HEV infected patients following RTX-containing treatment regimens might be difficult to treat.\",\"Seasonal influenza viruses cause major morbidity and mortality worldwide, threatening in particular older adults and the immunocompromised. Two classes of influenza therapeutics dominate current disease management, but both are compromised by pre-existing or rapidly emerging viral resistance. We have recently reported a novel ribonucleoside analog clinical candidate, EIDD-2801, that combines potent antiviral efficacy in ferrets and human airway epithelium cultures with a high barrier against viral escape. In this study, we established fundamental EIDD-2801 efficacy paradigms against pandemic and seasonal influenza A virus (IAV) strains in ferrets that can be used to inform exposure targets and treatment regimens. Based on reduction of shed virus titers, alleviation of clinical signs, and lowered virus burden in upper and lower respiratory tract tissues, lowest efficacious oral dose concentrations of EIDD-2801, given twice daily, were 2.3 and 7 mg/kg of body weight against seasonal and pandemic IAVs, respectively. The latest opportunity for initiation of efficacious treatment was 36 hours after infection of ferrets. Administered in 12-hour intervals, three 7 mg/kg doses of EIDD-2801 were sufficient for maximal therapeutic benefit against a pandemic IAV and significantly shortened the time to resolution of clinical signs. Ferrets infected with pandemic IAV and treated following the minimally efficacious EIDD-2801 regimen demonstrated significantly less shed virus and inflammatory cellular infiltrates in nasal lavages, but mounted a robust humoral antiviral response after recovery that was indistinguishable from that of vehicle-treated animals. These results provide an experimental basis in a human disease-relevant influenza animal model for clinical testing of EIDD-2801.\",\"Sofosbuvir, a licensed nucleotide analog targeting hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), has been recently evaluated as a broad anti-Flavivirus lead candidate revealing activity against Zika and Dengue viruses both in vitro and in animal models. In this study, the in vitro antiviral activity of sofosbuvir against West Nile virus (WNV) was determined by plaque assay (PA) and Immunodetection Assay (IA) in human cell lines and by enzymatic RdRp assay. By PA, the sofosbuvir half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 1.2 \\u00b1 0.3 \\u03bcM in Huh-7, 5.3 \\u00b1 0.9 \\u03bcM in U87, 7.8 \\u00b1 2.5 \\u03bcM in LN-18 and 63.4 \\u00b1 14.1 \\u03bcM in A549 cells. By IA, anti-WNV activity was confirmed in both hepatic (Huh-7, 1.7 \\u00b1 0.5 \\u03bcM) and neuronal (U87, 7.3 \\u00b1 2.0 \\u03bcM) cell types. Sofosbuvir was confirmed to inhibit the purified WNV RdRp (IC50 11.1 \\u00b1 4.6 \\u03bcM). In vitro resistance selection experiments were performed by propagating WNV in the Huh-7 cell line with two-fold increasing concentrations of sofosbuvir. At 80 \\u03bcM, a significantly longer time for viral breakthrough was observed compared with lower concentrations (18 vs. 7-9 days post infection; p = 0.029), along with the detection of the S604T mutation, corresponding to the well-known S282T substitution in the motif B of HCV NS5B, which confers resistance to sofosbuvir. Molecular docking experiments confirmed that the S604T mutation within the catalytic site of RdRp affected the binding mode of sofosbuvir. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the antiviral activity of sofosbuvir against WNV as well as of selection of mutants in vitro.\",\"Presatovir significantly reduced nasal viral load, signs, and symptoms of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in a human challenge study. We evaluated presatovir in hematopoietic-cell transplant (HCT) recipients with RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI).\",\"The current Ebolavirus disease (EVD) outbreak in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri is the tenth outbreak affecting the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); the first outbreak occurring in a war context, and the second most deadly Ebolavirus outbreak on record following the 2014 outbreak in West Africa. The DRC government's response consisted of applying a package of interventions including detection and rapid isolation of cases, contact tracing, population mapping, and identification of high-risk areas to inform a coordinated effort. The coordinated effort was to screen, ring vaccinate, and conduct laboratory diagnoses using GeneXpert (Cepheid) polymerase chain reaction. The effort also included ensuring safe and dignified burials and promoting risk communication, community engagement, and social mobilization. Following the adoption of the \\\"Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Products Protocol,\\\" a randomized controlled trial of four investigational treatments (mAb114, ZMapp, and REGN-EB3 and Remdesivir) was carried out with all consenting patients with laboratory-confirmed EVD. REGN-EB3 and mAb114 showed promise as treatments for EVD. In addition, one investigational vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV-GP) was used first, followed by a second prophylactic vaccine (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo) to reinforce the prevention. Although the provision of clinical supportive care remains the cornerstone of EVD outbreak management, the DRC response faced daunting challenges including general insecurity, violence and community resistance, appalling poverty, and entrenched distrust of authority. Ebolavirus remains a public health threat. A fully curative treatment is unlikely to be a game-changer given the settings of transmission, zoonotic nature, limits of effectiveness of any therapeutic intervention, and timing of presentation.\",\"The use of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection results in sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of 95%-97%, but 3%-5% of patients experience virologic failure. We observed 17 patients infected with HCV subtype 1b who failed previous treatment with DAA, including 13 subjects (76.5%) with liver cirrhosis. Twelve subjects (70.6%) previously received NS5A inhibitors of the first generation (ledipasvir or daclatasvir) and five subjects (29.4%) - the second generation (velpatasvir). All patients were retreated with a combination of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir (3D) with sofosbuvir (SOF) and ribavirin (RBV). We compared SVR12 rates depending on fibrosis stage, presence of just single or double NS5A mutations (L31M/V/I and/or Y93H), and on the generation of previously used NS5A inhibitor. Observed SVR12 rates were as follows: 94.1% (16/17 patients) overall; 100% in patients without cirrhosis (n = 4) vs 92.3% in those with cirrhosis (n = 13); 100% with single L31M/V/I or Y93H mutation (n = 7) vs 88.9% with double mutations (n = 9); 100% in patients who previously failed first generation (n = 12) vs 80.0% in those failed second-generation NS5A inhibitors (n = 5). Retreatment with 3D + 0SOF + RBV was highly effective and safe in patients with chronic HCV GT1b infection who failed previous use of NS5A inhibitors. Fibrosis stage, baseline presence of NS5A RAS mutations and the generation of previously used NS5A inhibitors may impact the probability of achieving SVR12 , but statistical significance was not demonstrated in our small retrospective cohort. Further studies in a larger population are needed to confirm or not the predictive value of these baseline factors.\",\"NS5A-P32 deletion (P32del) is a resistance-associated amino acid change that has recently gained popularity in direct-acting antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis C. Although not yet detected in naive patients, it appears in 5 to 10% of hepatitis C genotype 1b patients who fail to respond to daclatasvir/asunaprevir and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir treatments. In contrast to signature resistance-associated substitutions, such as substitutions at the NS5A-L31 and NS5A-Y93 positions, it shows complete resistance to all NS5A inhibitors in replicon and cell culture. Studies of humanized liver mice suggest that P32del retains good replication fitness and requires two classes of antivirals, except NS5A inhibitors, to be suppressed effectively. Patients with the P32del virus do not respond to glecaprevir/pibrentasvir but do respond to sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, presumably to sofosbuvir + glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, and at least partially to sofosbuvir/velpatasvir + ribavirin. Attention should be given to P32del in patients who experience failure with any NS5A inhibitor, especially those with genotype 1b infection.\",\"A percentage of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients fail direct acting antiviral (DAA)-based treatment regimens, often because of drug resistance-associated substitutions (RAS). The aim of this study was to characterize the resistance profile of a large cohort of patients failing DAA-based treatments, and investigate the relationship between HCV subtype and failure, as an aid to optimizing management of these patients. A new, standardized HCV-RAS testing protocol based on deep sequencing was designed and applied to 220 previously subtyped samples from patients failing DAA treatment, collected in 39 Spanish hospitals. The majority had received DAA-based interferon (IFN) \\u03b1-free regimens; 79% had failed sofosbuvir-containing therapy. Genomic regions encoding the nonstructural protein (NS) 3, NS5A, and NS5B (DAA target regions) were analyzed using subtype-specific primers. Viral subtype distribution was as follows: genotype (G) 1, 62.7%; G3a, 21.4%; G4d, 12.3%; G2, 1.8%; and mixed infections 1.8%. Overall, 88.6% of patients carried at least 1 RAS, and 19% carried RAS at frequencies below 20% in the mutant spectrum. There were no differences in RAS selection between treatments with and without ribavirin. Regardless of the treatment received, each HCV subtype showed specific types of RAS. Of note, no RAS were detected in the target proteins of 18.6% of patients failing treatment, and 30.4% of patients had RAS in proteins that were not targets of the inhibitors they received. HCV patients failing DAA therapy showed a high diversity of RAS. Ribavirin use did not influence the type or number of RAS at failure. The subtype-specific pattern of RAS emergence underscores the importance of accurate HCV subtyping. The frequency of \\\"extra-target\\\" RAS suggests the need for RAS screening in all three DAA target regions.\",\"Ribavirin remains relevant for successful treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in low-income settings, as well as for therapy of difficult-to-treat HCV patients. We studied the effect of ribavirin against cell-culture adapted HCV of genotypes 1, 2 and 3, representing ~80% of global infections. TNcc(1a) was the most sensitive to ribavirin, while J6/JFH1(2a) was the most resistant. EC50s ranged from 21 \\u03bcM (95%CI: 20-22 \\u03bcM) to 189 \\u03bcM (95%CI: 173-207 \\u03bcM). Substitutions at position 415 of NS5B resulted in little or no change to ribavirin sensitivity (0.7-0.9 fold) but conferred moderate drug resistance during extended treatment of genotype 1 (1.8-fold). NS5A and NS5B sequences could alter ribavirin sensitivity 2-4-fold, although their contribution was not simply additive. Finally, we detected limited accumulation of mutations associated with ribavirin treatment. Our findings show that the antiviral effect of ribavirin on HCV is strain-dependent and is influenced by the specific sequence of multiple HCV nonstructural proteins.\",\"A series of compounds with potential activity to induce plant resistance was synthesized from indole and thiol compounds and methodically evaluated for antiviral activity. The results indicated that some of the synthesized compounds had high antipotato virus Y (PVY), anticucumber mosaic virus, and antitobacco mosaic virus activities. Notably, compound D21 exhibited the best activity against PVY among these compounds in vivo, and the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of protection activity is 122 \\u03bcg/mL, which was distinctively better than the corresponding values for ribavirin (653 \\u03bcg/mL), Ningnanmycin (464 \\u03bcg/mL), and Xiangcaoliusuobingmi (279 \\u03bcg/mL). Interestingly, we found that the protection activity of D21 was associated with improvement of chlorophyll content and defense-related enzyme activities. Moreover, D21 could trigger the malate dehydrogenase (MDH) signaling pathway, as further confirmed by the MDH activity evaluation. Hence, D21 can protect plants against viral activity and has potential as a novel activator for plant resistance induction.\",\"Influenza viruses constitute a major health threat and economic burden globally, frequently exacerbated by preexisting or rapidly emerging resistance to antiviral therapeutics. To address the unmet need of improved influenza therapy, we have created EIDD-2801, an isopropylester prodrug of the ribonucleoside analog N [4]-hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931) that has shown broad anti-influenza virus activity in cultured cells and mice. Pharmacokinetic profiling demonstrated that EIDD-2801 was orally bioavailable in ferrets and nonhuman primates. Therapeutic oral dosing of influenza virus-infected ferrets reduced group pandemic 1 and group 2 seasonal influenza A shed virus load by multiple orders of magnitude and alleviated fever, airway epithelium histopathology, and inflammation, whereas postexposure prophylactic dosing was sterilizing. Deep sequencing highlighted lethal viral mutagenesis as the underlying mechanism of activity and revealed a prohibitive barrier to the development of viral resistance. Inhibitory concentrations were low nanomolar against influenza A and B viruses in disease-relevant well-differentiated human air-liquid interface airway epithelia. Correlating antiviral efficacy and cytotoxicity thresholds with pharmacokinetic profiles in human airway epithelium models revealed a therapeutic window >1713 and established dosing parameters required for efficacious human therapy. These data recommend EIDD-2801 as a clinical candidate with high potential for monotherapy of seasonal and pandemic influenza virus infections. Our results inform EIDD-2801 clinical trial design and drug exposure targets.\",\"There is an established correlation between the PNPLA3 rs738409 C > G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients. However not all data is convergent regarding the exact impact of this SNP on the pattern of disease progression in different clinical settings. In this study, we aimed to further bridge the knowledge gap on this topic by investigating the role of the G allele in promoting steatosis, fibrosis and disease progression in relation to other metabolic and anthropometric host factors. Two hundred and fifty consecutive patients, previously diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) underwent liver biopsy. Histology was assessed using the Metavir scoring system. Transient elastography was used for follow-up. Ninety-eight patients were genotyped for PNPLA3 rs738409 and followed up for fibrosis progression. PNPLA3 rs738409[G] allele was significantly correlated with severe steatosis (P = 0.04), severe fibrosis at the time of enrollment (P = 0.0005) and fibrosis progression with an OR of 10.31 (95% CI 1.06 - 99.59, P = 0.04), after a mean follow-up time of 62.85 (95%CI: 52.21 - 76.15) months. Severe steatosis at the time of enrollment had an OR of 11.02 (95% CI 1.48 - 82.09, P = 0.01) for the association with fibrosis progression. The HOMA-IR index was also positively correlated with severe fibrosis (P = 0.03) and fibrosis progression on univariate analysis (P = 0.02). PNPLA3 rs738409[G] allele is a reliable predictor for steatosis and fibrosis in CHC. The presence of G allele, along with severe steatosis and insulin resistance are significant predictors for fibrosis progression.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease globally. Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have proven effective in curing HCV. However, the current standard of care (SOC) in Botswana remains PEGylated interferon-\\u03b1 (IFN-\\u03b1) with ribavirin. Several mutations have been reported to confer resistance to interferon-based treatments. Therefore, there is a need to determine HCV genotypes in Botswana, as these data will guide new treatment guidelines and understanding of HCV epidemiology in Botswana.\",\"Background and Aims: Ravidasvir (RDV) is a new generation pangenotypic hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor, with high barrier to baseline resistance-associated species. This is the first phase 2/3 study conducted in Mainland China confirming the efficacy and safety of RDV + ritonavir-boosted danoprevir + ribavirin for 12 weeks in treatment-na\\u00efve noncirrhotic patients with genotype 1 infection in a large population. Methods: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2/3 trial (NCT03362814), we enrolled 424 treatment-na\\u00efve, noncirrhotic adult HCV genotype 1 patients. All patients were randomized at 3:1 ratio to receive a combination of RDV 200mg once daily plus ritonavir-boosted danoprevir 100mg/100mg twice daily and oral ribavirin 1000/1200mg/day (body weight <75/\\u226575 kg) (n = 318) or placebo (n = 106) for 12 weeks. The primary end-point was the rate of sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment, and the safety was evaluated and compared between treatment and placebo groups. Results: The overall rate of sustained virological response at 12 weeks after treatment is 99% (306/309, 95%, CI: 97%-100%) under per protocol set analysis. All patients harboring baseline NS5A resistance-associated species in the treatment group (76/76, per protocol set) achieved sustained virological response at 12 weeks after treatment. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. Laboratory abnormalities showed mild or moderate severity (grade 1 and grade 2) in liver function tests. Conclusions: In treatment-na\\u00efve, noncirrhotic HCV Chinese patients infected with HCV genotype 1, all-oral regimen of RDV + ritonavir-boosted danoprevir + ribavirin for 12 weeks was highly efficacious, safe, and well tolerated.\",\"The incidence of fungal infections has increased continuously in recent years, and drug resistance, especially resistance to fluconazole (FLC), has emerged. To overcome this challenge, research on the antifungal activities of non-antifungal agents has gained more attention. In this study, we determined the anti-Candida activity of ribavirin (RBV), an antiviral drug commonly used in the clinic, and found that RBV displayed potent antifungal activity when used alone or in combination with FLC in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the MIC80 values of RBV were 2-4 \\u00b5g/mL for FLC-susceptible Candida albicans and 8 \\u00b5g/mL for FLC-resistant C. albicans. When RBV at a dose of 1 \\u00b5g/mL was combined with FLC, significant synergistic effects were exhibited against FLC-resistant C. albicans, and the MICs of FLC decreased from >512 \\u00b5g/mL to 0.25-1 \\u00b5g/mL. Synergism was also exhibited against C. albicans biofilms. In vivo, RBV plus FLC significantly improved the survival of infected Galleria mellonella larvae compared with the FLC-treated group over a 4-day period and attenuated the damage of FLC-resistant C. albicans to G. mellonella larvae tissue. Furthermore, mechanistic studies indicated that the antifungal effects of RBV used alone or in combination with FLC might be associated with inhibition of biofilm formation, reduced extracellular phospholipase activity and inhibition of hyphal growth, but is not related to promotion of FLC uptake and inhibition of FLC efflux. These results provide a promising direction for overcoming drug resistance and for expanding the clinical application of existing drugs.\",\"Sustained virological response (SVR) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients treated with pegylated interferon \\u03b1-2a and ribavirin is associated with reduced insulin resistance (IR), measured as a reduction of homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) scores after 24 weeks of therapy, and reduced fasting serum insulin and serum glucose levels. The present meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of HCV treatment response on IR in HCV patients who achieved SVR and those who did not (non-SVR) after receiving interferon (IFN)-based therapy. The PubMed, Cochrane and Embase databases were searched using combinations of the following search terms: 'HCV', 'hepatitis C', 'interferon', 'antiviral', 'treatment response' and 'insulin resistance'. The incidence of IR, HOMA-IR and HOMA-\\u03b2, as well as fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels, were summarized in terms of basal values and values after the end of treatment for each study. A total of 8 studies were included in the final analysis. There was no significant difference in the reduction in IR between the SVR and non-SVR groups (odds ratio, 0.995; 95% CI=0.613-1.616; P=0.984). However, the SVR group had a significantly higher mean reduction in HOMA-IR (difference in means=-0.485; 95%CI=-0.713 to -0.256; P<0.001) and HOMA-\\u03b2 (difference in means=-15.448; 95%CI=-23.326 to -7.570; P<0.001) compared to the non-SVR group. In conclusion, HCV patients who achieved SVR after IFN-based therapy exhibited improvement in HOMA-IR and HOMA-\\u03b2. The present results suggest that clinical management of IR and serum glucose levels may be an important way to impact the therapeutic response in HCV patients.\",\"Ribavirin (RBV) induces nucleotide (nt) substitutions in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome nonstructural (NS) regions. Although emergence of drug resistance-associated variants is associated with direct-acting antiviral treatment failure, the effect of RBV on genome substitutions in such patients is unknown. Genotype 1b HCV subgenomic replicon cells were treated with RBV for 120 hours. Six patients with chronic genotype 1b with HCV-infected patients who failed to respond to prior daclatasvir plus asunaprevir (DCV/ASV) therapy were treated with 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir plus RBV after 4 weeks of RBV monotherapy. RBV-induced genome mutations in the HCV NS region (nt3493-9301) in replicon cells and in patients during 4 weeks of RBV monotherapy were analyzed by deep sequencing. RBV-associated G-to-A and C-to-U transitions increased in a dose-dependent manner in HCV replicon cells after the RBV treatment. In patients with prior DCV/ASV treatment failures, the median serum HCV RNA level was 6.25 \\u00b1 0.31 log IU/mL at the start of RBV therapy and decreased significantly to 5.95 \\u00b1 0.4 log IU/mL (P = .03) after 4 weeks of RBV monotherapy. Although predominant HCV genome substitutions rates were similar between nontreatment and RBV-treatment periods (0.042 and 0.031 per base pair, respectively; P = .248), the frequencies of G-to-A and C-to-U transitions significantly increased after RBV monotherapy. These transitions were enriched, particularly within the HCV NS3 region in all patients. RBV treatment induces G-to-A and C-to-U transitions in the HCV genome even in chronic patients with hepatitis C with prior DCV/ASV treatment failures.\",\"Coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged from animal reservoirs to cause severe and lethal disease in humans, but there are currently no FDA-approved antivirals to treat the infections. One class of antiviral compounds, nucleoside analogues, mimics naturally occurring nucleosides to inhibit viral replication. While these compounds have been successful therapeutics for several viral infections, mutagenic nucleoside analogues, such as ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil, have been ineffective at inhibiting CoVs. This has been attributed to the proofreading activity of the viral 3'-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN). \\u03b2-d-N [4]-Hydroxycytidine (NHC) (EIDD-1931; Emory Institute for Drug Development) has recently been reported to inhibit multiple viruses. Here, we demonstrate that NHC inhibits both murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (50% effective concentration [EC50] = 0.17 \\u03bcM) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (EC50 = 0.56 \\u03bcM) with minimal cytotoxicity. NHC inhibited MHV lacking ExoN proofreading activity similarly to wild-type (WT) MHV, suggesting an ability to evade or overcome ExoN activity. NHC inhibited MHV only when added early during infection, decreased viral specific infectivity, and increased the number and proportion of G:A and C:U transition mutations present after a single infection. Low-level NHC resistance was difficult to achieve and was associated with multiple transition mutations across the genome in both MHV and MERS-CoV. These results point to a virus-mutagenic mechanism of NHC inhibition in CoVs and indicate a high genetic barrier to NHC resistance. Together, the data support further development of NHC for treatment of CoVs and suggest a novel mechanism of NHC interaction with the CoV replication complex that may shed light on critical aspects of replication.IMPORTANCE The emergence of coronaviruses (CoVs) into human populations from animal reservoirs has demonstrated their epidemic capability, pandemic potential, and ability to cause severe disease. However, no antivirals have been approved to treat these infections. Here, we demonstrate the potent antiviral activity of a broad-spectrum ribonucleoside analogue, \\u03b2-d-N [4]-hydroxycytidine (NHC), against two divergent CoVs. Viral proofreading activity does not markedly impact sensitivity to NHC inhibition, suggesting a novel interaction between a nucleoside analogue inhibitor and the CoV replicase. Further, passage in the presence of NHC generates only low-level resistance, likely due to the accumulation of multiple potentially deleterious transition mutations. Together, these data support a mutagenic mechanism of inhibition by NHC and further support the development of NHC for treatment of CoV infections.\",\"To study resistance-associated substitutions using next-generation sequencing in Egyptian hepatitis C virus-infected patients failing direct-acting antiviral treatment.\",\"The World Health Organization estimates that 1% of the world population (71 million) is infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). In 2015, three direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), simeprevir (SMV), sofosbuvir (SOF) and daclatasvir (DCV) were included in the Brazilian protocol for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Despite the fact that the use of these drugs is associated with higher treatment response rates and with lower incidence of side effects, studies have shown the association between the presence of viral resistance mutations and the failure of pharmacological treatment.\",\"New direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) approved for the treatment of patients infected by Hepatitis C virus (HCV) are well tolerated and increase sustained virological response (SVR) rate. We summarize current evidence on the efficacy and safety from comparative randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of DAAs.\",\"As antiviral drug resistance develops and new viruses emerge there is a pressing need to develop strategies to rapidly develop antiviral therapeutics. Here we use phospho-specific flow cytometry to assess perturbations of many different cellular signaling pathways during treatment with drug combinations that are highly effective in blocking Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. We discovered two antiviral drug combinations act on distinct signaling pathways, either STAT1 or S6 phosphorylation, to block HSV-1 infection. We focused on upregulation of S6 phosphorylation by HSV-1 infection, and our subsequent finding that ribavirin antagonizes this upregulation of S6 phosphorylation. We go on to show that the S6 kinase inhibitor SL0101 blocks HSV-1 replication in vitro and in an in vivo animal model of HSV-1 infection. Overall, we have used an unbiased analysis of cellular signaling pathways during treatment by antiviral drug combinations to discover a novel antiviral drug target against HSV-1 infection. The outcomes of the approach we present highlight the importance of analyzing how antiviral drugs modulate cellular and pathogen-induced signaling as a method to discover new drug therapy targets.\",\"Treatment guidelines differ in their recommendation to determine baseline resistance associated substitutions (RAS) before starting a first-line treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Here we analyze the efficacy of DAA treatment with baseline RAS information. We conducted a prospective study involving 23 centers collaborating in the GEHEP-004 DAA resistance cohort. Baseline NS5A and NS3 RASs were studied by Sanger sequencing. After issuing a comprehensive resistance report, the treating physician decided the therapy, duration and ribavirin use. Sustained virological response (SVR12) data are available in 275 patients. Baseline NS5A RAS prevalence was between 4.3% and 26.8% according to genotype, and NS3 RASs prevalence (GT1a) was 6.3%. Overall, SVR12 was 97.8%. Amongst HCV-GT1a patients, 75.0% had >800,000 IU/ml and most of those that started grazoprevir/elbasvir were treated for 12 weeks. In genotype 3, NS5A Y93H was detected in 9 patients. 42.8% of the HCV-GT3 patients that started sofosbuvir/velpatasvir included ribavirin, although only 14.7% carried Y93H. The efficacy of baseline resistance-guided treatment in our cohort has been high across the most prevalent HCV genotypes in Spain. The duration of the grazoprevir/elbasvir treatment adhered mostly to AASLD/IDSA recommendations. In cirrhotic patients infected with GT-3 there has been a high use of ribavirin.\",\"Sofosbuvir/velpatasivr/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) is approved for retreatment of patients with HCV and a previous failure on direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), however real-life data are limited. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of SOF/VEL/VOX in a real-life setting.\",\"Background: The NS5A resistance-associated substitution (RAS) Y93H is found quite frequently (5-10%) at baseline in direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) treatment-na\\u00efve genotype (GT) 3a patients when studied by the population-sequencing method (cut-off 20%). This RAS may impair HCV DAA treatment response, since it possesses a high fold in vitro resistance to daclatasvir (DCV) and velpatasvir (VEL) in GT 3. We investigated the effect of baseline Y93H in patients with GT 3a infection on treatment outcome, with or without resistance-based DAA-treatment during 2014-2017. Patients/Methods: Treatment in the intervention group (n = 130) was tailored to baseline resistance-findings by population-sequencing method. Detection of baseline Y93H above 20% prompted a prolonged treatment duration of NS5A-inhibitor and sofosbuvir (SOF) and/or addition of ribavirin (RBV). Patients without baseline Y93H in the intervention group and all patients in the control group (n = 78) received recommended standard DAA-treatment. Results: A higher sustained virologic response rate (SVR) in the intervention group was shown compared to the control group at 95.4% (124/130) and 88.5% (69/78), respectively (p = .06). All five patients with baseline Y93H in the intervention group achieved SVR with personalised treatment based on results from resistance testing; either with the addition of RBV or prolonged treatment duration (24w). In the control group, 2/4 patients with Y93H at baseline treated with ledipasvir/SOF/RBV or DCV/SOF without RBV, failed treatment. Conclusion: The results from this real-life study are in accordance with the findings of the randomised controlled trials in 2015 and the EASL-guidelines of 2016, thus, baseline Y93H impacts on DCV and VEL treatment outcome.\",\"Treatment options are limited for patients with hepatitis C (HCV) infection with treatment failure after sofosbuvir plus an NS5A inhibitor. There are some data for the efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) in these patients. We performed a randomized trial of the safety and efficacy of 12 and 16 weeks of G/P, with or without ribavirin, in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection with treatment failure after sofosbuvir and an NS5A inhibitor.\",\"The human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common viral pathogens that affects the lower respiratory tract and could be a reason of bronchiolitis and/or pneumonia. Currently, there are no available effective ways of treating the RSV infection. Attempts to develop preventive vaccine have been unsuccessful. The only therapeutic agent used for RSV treatment is virazole (ribavirin); however, it induces adverse effects. Medications based on neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, such as IGIV (Respigam), palivizumab (Synagis), and MEDI-524 (Numab), are under clinical trials; however, their use will be limited by their high cost. One of the promising approaches for antiviral therapy is the use of natural peptides (defensins and cathelicidins), or their synthetic analogs. The majority of currently described antiviral peptides are developed against the human immunodeficiency virus, the herpes simplex virus, and the influenza virus. At the same time, a body of experimental data evidencing anti-RSV activity of peptides has been accumulated. The main advantages of peptide drugs are their wide spectrum of antiviral activity and low toxicity. However, there are obstacles in implementing peptide-based drugs in clinical practice. Due to their low resistance to the action of serum proteases, most authors consider peptides promising only for local application. Given that RSV affects the epithelium of the respiratory tract, where the protease activity is lower than in the systemic circulation, it is possible to develop locally active peptide drugs, for example, as inhalation forms. Their stability could also be increased by the synthesis of dendrimer peptides and by the development of recombinant peptides as precursor proteins. Anti-RSV peptides can be divided into several groups: (1) attachment and/or fusion blockers; (2) peptides displaying direct virucidal activity, disrupting the viral envelope. Such peptides, which suppress early stages of the viral life cycle, are considered prophylactic agents. However, for several peptides, their immunoregulatory properties have been described, which opens the possibility for therapeutic use. This review summarizes the information on the antiviral properties of such peptides and mechanisms of their action and describes the prospects of the future development of antiviral peptides.\",\"Direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA)-based therapies have been the 1st choice of antiviral agents for chronic hepatitis C throughout the world. The treatment period of DAA-based therapy has been greatly shortened by the improvement of their efficiency. Thus, glecaprevir (GLE)/pibrentasvir (PIB) therapy has enabled the therapeutic period to be reduced from 12 to 8 weeks in cases of genotype 1 or 2 chronic hepatitis C without liver cirrhosis. Currently, there is no established rescue therapy for patients who experience treatment failure on GLE/PIB therapy; however, some patients have been rescued by other regimens, including sofosbuvir (SOF)/velpatasvir (VEL) plus ribavirin (RBV) therapy and GLE/PIB, SOF, and RBV therapy. We experienced the case of a DAA-na\\u00efve non-cirrhotic patient with genotype 2a who showed virologic relapse at post-treatment week 13 following 8-week GLE/PIB therapy. After we confirmed that he did not have resistance-associated substitutions against GLE or PIB, we tried to rescue the patient using prolonged (12-week) GLE/PIB therapy. Fortunately, a sustained virologic response was achieved without any adverse events. Although this was a single-case report and is assumed to be rare, the same regimen might be effective for treatment failure with 8-week GLE/PIB therapy.\",\"Human innate immune plays an essential role in the spontaneous clearance of acute infection and therapy of HCV. We investigated whether the SNPs in retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor family were associated with HCV spontaneous clearance and response to treatment. To evaluate the clinical value of DDX58 rs3824456, rs10813831 and rs10738889 genotypes on HCV spontaneous clearance and treatment response in Chinese Han population, we genotyped 1001 HCV persistent infectors, 599 participants with HCV natural clearance and 354 patients with PEGylated interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin (PEG IFN-\\u03b1/RBV) treatment. People carrying rs10813831-G allele genotype were more liable to achieve spontaneous clearance than the carriage of the T allele (dominant model: adjusted OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.71, P = 0.008). In rs10738889, the rate of persistent infection was significantly lower in patients with the TC genotype compared to those with TT genotype (dominant model: adjusted OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.06-1.74, P = 0.015). Multivariate stepwise analysis indicated that rs10738889, age, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were independent predictors for HCV spontaneous clearance. However, there were no significant differences in the three selection SNPs between the non-SVR group and the SVR group. These results suggest the DDX58 rs10813831 and rs10738889 are associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV, which may be identified as a predictive marker in the Chinese Han population of HCV.\",\"Despite highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, some patients experience virological relapse. Salvage regimens should include multiple agents to suppress emergence of resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) and minimise treatment failure. The combination of sofosbuvir (SOF) and elbasvir/grazoprevir (ELB/GZR) \\u00b1ribavirin (RBV) is an effective retreatment strategy for HCV genotype (GT)1 and 4 infection. We hypothesised that SOF and ELB/GZR (\\u00b1RBV) would also be an effective salvage regimen for DAA-experienced GT3 patients.\",\"The use of antifungal agents in clinical settings is limited by the appearance of drug resistance and adverse side effects. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop new drugs to strengthen the treatment of invasive fungal diseases. The aim of this study is to describe the potential repurposing of ribavirin as an adjunct therapy against Candida spp. Primary screening of a Prestwick Chemical library against Candida albicans ATCC 90028 and fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans strains was performed. Subsequently, we evaluated the responses of 100 Candida sp. strains to ribavirin, an antiviral agent, using the broth microdilution method as recommended by CLSI. We checked the involvement of efflux pump activity in the development of ribavirin resistance. We studied time-kill curves and performed a checkerboard assay for a ribavirin-antifungal combination study. Twenty-one nonstandard antifungal compounds were identified, including ribavirin. Ribavirin had antifungal activity in vitro against 63 Candida strains, including strains of C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis, with MICs ranging from 0.37 to 3.02 \\u03bcg/ml, while MICs for C. krusei, C. glabrata, C. lusitaniae, and some C. albicans strains remained high (\\u226524.16 \\u03bcg/ml). No relation was observed between efflux pump activity and ribavirin resistance. Ribavirin exhibited fungistatic activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) C. albicans and fungicidal activity against a C. parapsilosis strain. In addition, ribavirin acted synergistically with azoles against Candida strains for which ribavirin MICs were <24.4 \\u03bcg/ml. This study highlights the potential clinical application of ribavirin, alone or in association with other antifungal agents, as an adjunct anti-Candida drug.\",\"Most hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients failing NS5A inhibitors develop resistance-associated substitutions (RASs). Here we report the use of resistance-guided retreatment of patients who failed prior NS5A inhibitor-containing regimens in the GEHEP-004 cohort.

We aim to provide indications on how to use resistance information in settings where sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir may not be available.\",\"We examined treatment the efficacy and data on long-term outcomes in real-world Japanese patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 treated with 12-week sofosbuvir/ribavirin combination therapy.\",\"Development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has made antihepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment highly safe and effective. However, the emergence of resistant-associated variants (RAVs) after failure of DAA therapy affects retreatment outcomes. In particular, genotype 1 HCV with P32 deletion has been reported to be highly resistant to all approved non-structural protein (NS)5A inhibitors. However, analysis of RAVs in genotype 2 HCV has been limited. Accordingly, in this study, we evaluated the roles of genotype 2 HCV variants in antiviral drug efficacy.\",\"Current influenza antivirals have limitations with regard to their effectiveness and the potential emergence of resistance. Encouragingly, several new compounds which inhibit the polymerase of influenza viruses have recently been shown to have enhanced pre-clinical and clinical effectiveness compared to the neuraminidase inhibitors, the mainstay of influenza antiviral therapy over the last two decades. In this review we focus on four compounds which inhibit polymerase function, baloxavir marboxil, favipiravir, pimodivir and AL-794 and discuss their clinical and virological effectiveness, their propensity to select for resistance and their potential for future combination therapy with the most commonly used neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir.\",\"The genetically diverse Orthocoronavirinae (CoV) family is prone to cross species transmission and disease emergence in both humans and livestock. Viruses similar to known epidemic strains circulating in wild and domestic animals further increase the probability of emergence in the future. Currently, there are no approved therapeutics for any human CoV presenting a clear unmet medical need. Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog with potent activity against an array of RNA virus families including Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Orthocoronavirinae, through the targeting of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed multiple assays to further define the breadth of RDV antiviral activity against the CoV family. Here, we show potent antiviral activity of RDV against endemic human CoVs OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 229E (HCoV-229E) with submicromolar EC50 values. Of known CoVs, the members of the deltacoronavirus genus have the most divergent RdRp as compared to SARS- and MERS-CoV and both avian and porcine members harbor a native residue in the RdRp that confers resistance in beta-CoVs. Nevertheless, RDV is highly efficacious against porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). These data further extend the known breadth and antiviral activity of RDV to include both contemporary human and highly divergent zoonotic CoV and potentially enhance our ability to fight future emerging CoV.\",\"Chronic viral disease constitutes a major global health problem, with several hundred million people affected and an associated elevated number of deaths. An increasing number of disorders caused by human flaviviruses are related to their capacity to establish a persistent infection. Here we show that Usutu virus (USUV), an emerging zoonotic flavivirus linked to sporadic neurologic disease in humans, can establish a persistent infection in cell culture. Two independent lineages of Vero cells surviving USUV lytic infection were cultured over 82 days (41 cell transfers) without any apparent cytopathology crisis associated. We found elevated titers in the supernatant of these cells, with modest fluctuations during passages but no overall tendency towards increased or decreased infectivity. In addition to full-length genomes, viral RNA isolated from these cells at passage 40 revealed the presence of defective genomes, containing different deletions at the 5' end. These truncated transcripts were all predicted to encode shorter polyprotein products lacking membrane and envelope structural proteins, and most of non-structural protein 1. Treatment with different broad-range antiviral nucleosides revealed that USUV is sensitive to these compounds in the context of a persistent infection, in agreement with previous observations during lytic infections. The exposure of infected cells to prolonged treatment (10 days) with favipiravir and/or ribavirin resulted in the complete clearance of infectivity in the cellular supernatants (decrease of ~5 log10 in virus titers and RNA levels), although modest changes in intracellular viral RNA levels were recorded (<2 log10 decrease). Drug withdrawal after treatment day 10 resulted in a relapse in virus titers. These results encourage the use of persistently-infected cultures as a surrogate system in the identification of improved antivirals against flaviviral chronic disease.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus infection represents a more frequent cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Statins, inhibit HCV replication in vitro, enhance the antiviral effect of the already known antiviral drugs and reduce their resistance.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is commonly associated with a disturbance of glucose metabolism.

Patients with HCV who are considered \\\"hard-to-cure\\\" have generally been excluded from registration trials due to rigorous study inclusion criteria, presence of comorbidities and previous treatment failures.\",\"The effectiveness of sofosbuvir/ribavirin (SOF/RBV) combination therapy, which is one of the 1[st]-choice therapeutic options for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 (HCV-G2) in Japan according to the most recent version of the Japan Society of Hepatology guideline, for patients who experienced failure of the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus ribavirin (OBV/PTV/r+RBV) combination therapy, which was another option for patients with HCV-G2, is unknown.\",\"Sofosbuvir is a frequently used pan-genotype inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) polymerase. This drug eliminates most chronic HCV infections, and resistance-associated substitutions in the polymerase are rare. However, HCV genotype 3 responds slightly less well to sofosbuvir-based therapies than other genotypes. We collected data from England's National Health Service Early Access Program to search for virus factors associated with sofosbuvir treatment failure.\",\"Despite the high efficacy of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) not all patients successfully clear hepatitis C virus infection, in fact, approximately 1-3% fail to reach a sustained virological response 12 weeks after end of treatment. DAA failures are characterized by advanced liver disease, specific genotypes/subtypes and resistance associated substitutions to the DAA class they have been treated with. Current European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines recommend three therapeutic options for such patients. The first is a 12 week course of sofosbuvir (SOF), velpatasvir (VEL) and voxilaprevir (VOX), which has shown to be effective in 90-99% of patients and was granted A1 level recommendation. The second option, reserved for patients who have predictors of failure consists in 12 weeks regimen with glecaprevir (GLE) and pibrentasvir (PIB), effective in 90-97%. Finally, although not supported by published data, for especially difficult to treat patients there should theoretically be a benefit in prolonged combinations of SOF+GLE/PIB or SOF/VEL/VOX\\u00b1ribavirin. This review presents the latest evidence from both clinical trials and real-life on such therapeutic strategies.\",\"The treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has considerably evolved with the development of safe and well-tolerated combinations of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs yielding high rates of infection cure. However, some patients fail to achieve a sustained virological response while receiving the most recent DAA combinations. Several waves of treatment failures have occurred concomitantly to the use of different drug combinations. The outcome of their retreatment strongly depends on the DAA(s) received and the retreatment regimen(s) available. This article discusses virological failure rates with the successive waves of HCV combination regimens, the reasons for failure, the role of HCV resistance, and current retreatment options. The triple combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir for 12 weeks is the first-line retreatment strategy in patients previously exposed to DAAs. Difficult-to-retreat patients may benefit from the combination of sofosbuvir plus glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and/or the addition of ribavirin and/or longer retreatment duration.\",\"Cirrhotic patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 3 infection show unsatisfactory outcomes after 12 weeks' treatment with direct antiviral agents. The National Italian Drug Agency allows 24 weeks of therapy in difficult-to-treat patients, including genotype 3 cirrhotics. Aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of a 24-week course of sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir\\u00b1ribavirin in this population.\",\"Although overexpression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is associated with enhanced growth and poor prognosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), the function of eIF4E in NPC response to chemotherapy has not been revealed. In this work, we demonstrate that eIF4E inhibition using both ribavirin and siRNA targets NPC cells and enhances the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Mechanism studies indicate that 5-FU treatment increases phosphorylation of eIF4E in NPC cells, and this is dependent on ERK activation. eIF4E inhibition thus significantly sensitizes NPC cell response to 5-FU. Of note, ribavirin is a clinically available anti-viral drug. We show that ribavirin exhibits preferential toxicity to NPC with normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells largely unaffected. Ribavirin acts on NPC cells via inhibiting eIF4E/Akt signaling, and the suppression of eIF4E by ribavirin are not the consequence of inhibition of eIF4E upstream signaling: Mnk and mTOR. In two independent NPC xenograft mouse models, ribavirin at well-tolerated dose that significantly inhibited NPC growth as single drug alone and its combination with 5-FU completely arrests tumor growth throughout the whole duration of treatment, without causing toxicity in mice. Our findings provide the better understanding on the role of eIF4E in NPC in response to 5-FU and preclinical rationale to explore ribavirin as a sensitizing strategy to treat NPC, particularly in those who develop 5-FU resistance.\",\"Senecavirus A (SVA) is a reemerging virus, and recent evidence has emphasized the importance of SVA recombination in vivo on virus evolution. In this study, we report the development of an infectious cDNA clone for the SVA/HLJ/CHA/2016 strain. We used this strain to develop a reporter virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), which we then used to screen for a recombination-deficient SVA by an eGFP retention assay. Sequencing of the virus that retained the eGFP following passage allowed us to identify the nonsynonymous mutations (S460L alone and I212V-S460L in combination) in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region of the genome. We developed a Senecavirus-specific cell culture-based recombination assay, which we used to elucidate the role of RdRp in SVA recombination. Our results demonstrate that these two polymerase variants (S460L and I212/S460L) have reduced recombination capacity. These results indicate that the RdRp plays a central role in SVA replicative recombination. Notably, our results showed that the two recombination-deficient variants have higher replication fidelity than the wild type (WT) and display decreased ribavirin sensitivity compared to the WT. In addition, these two mutants exhibited significantly increased fitness in vitro compared to the WT. These results demonstrate that recombination and mutation rates are intimately linked. Our results have important implications for understanding the crucial role of the RdRp in virus recombination and fitness, especially in the molecular mechanisms of SVA evolution and pathogenicity.IMPORTANCE Recent evidence has emphasized the importance of SVA recombination on virus evolution in vivo We describe the first assays to study Senecavirus A recombination. The results show that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase plays a crucial role in recombination and that recombination can impact the fitness of SVA in cell culture. Further, SVA polymerase fidelity is closely related to recombination efficiency. The results provide key insights into the role of recombination in positive-strand RNA viruses.\",\"Resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the NS5A region impair the efficacy of NS5A inhibitors. In this study, we evaluated the characteristics of the novel RASs observed in treatment-failure patients, A92K and a deletion at P32 (P32del), and the susceptibility of viruses with these RASs to various anti-HCV reagents by using JFH-1 based recombinant HCV with NS5A from a genotype 1b Con1 strain (JFH1/5ACon1). We introduced A92K or P32del solely or in combination with Q24K, L28M, R30Q or L31F into the NS5A of JFH1/5ACon1. Viruses harboring R30Q/A92K showed high extracellular core antigens and infectivity titers, whereas the other viruses with RASs showed low replication levels and infectivity titers. All the viruses with A92K or P32del were markedly resistant to ledipasvir, velpatasvir and elbasvir. Interestingly, viruses with R30Q/A92K were more susceptible to grazoprevir than viruses without RAS. All the viruses had a similar susceptibility to ribavirin and sofosbuvir. In conclusion, combination RASs R30Q/A92K enhanced virus production whereas other RASs impaired virus replication. Both A92K and P32del conferred severe resistance even to second generation NS5A inhibitors. However, these viruses were susceptible to grazoprevir, ribavirin and sofosbuvir. Thus, combination regimens with these reagents may eradicate viruses harboring A92K or P32del.\",\"Resistance to adjuvant chemotherapy remains therapeutic challenge in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this work, we demonstrate that targeting eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is a potential sensitizing strategy to overcome chemoresistance in NPC. We observe the aberrant activation of eIF4E and translational upregulation of eIF4E-regulated oncogenes in NPC cell after pro-longed exposure of cisplatin. Functional analysis demonstrates that eIF4E depletion effectively inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant NPC cells. Consistently, eIF4E knockdown significantly enhances cisplatin efficacy in cisplatin-sensitive cells. We identify eIF4E as a therapeutically actionable targets by showing that ribavirin, an anti-viral drug, phenocopies the effects of eIF4E knockdown in NPC. We further demonstrate that ribavirin acts on chemoresistant NPC cells through suppressing eIF4E activity and oncogenic protein translation. Using two independent NPC xenograft mouse models, we show that ribavirin not only is effective in inhibiting chemoresistant NPC growth but also significantly augments the inhibitory effects of cisplatin efficacy in vivo without causing significant toxicity in mice. Taken together, our work shows an activation of eIF4E-mediated growth and survival mechanisms in response to chemotherapy and suggests that inhibition of eIF4E activity represents an attractive sensitizing strategy for NPC treatment. Our findings also suggest that ribavirin is a useful addition to the treatment armamentarium for NPC.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection perturbs lipid and glucose metabolism. The influenceof direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatment and ribavirin on these measures was evaluated.Furthermore, the effect of HCV cure on these parameters was assessed. Participants were allocatedto one of three 12-week treatment groups: non-cirrhotic genotype 1aparitaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir/dasabuvir (PrOD) plus ribavirin; non-cirrhotic 1b-PrOD;compensated cirrhotic 1a or 1b-PrOD plus ribavirin. Fasting insulin, glucose, lipid andapolipoprotein measures were assessed at baseline, Treatment Weeks 4 and 12, and 12 and 24 weekspost-dosing. Twenty-three of 24 participants achieved SVR (PP= 23/24, 96% SVR). Overall, totalcholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride levels all increased intreatment and post-dosing. However, LDL-C levels decreased during treatment in ribavirinrecipients. Fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR were unchanged during treatment and 12 weekspost-treatment. By 12 weeks post-treatment, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) scores, ameasure of steatosis, increased from baseline (mean 30.3 \\u00b1 63.5, p = 0.05). This regimen was safe andhighly effective and did not influence glucose metabolism. Ribavirin exposure may mitigate someon-treatment lipid changes. Further mechanistic studies are needed to understand how ribavirinimpacts lipid pathways, as there could be therapeutic implications. The metabolic pathophysiologyof increased CAP score with HCV treatment requires explanation.\",\"Preexistence and appearance of resistance-associated substitutions limit the efficacy of direct-acting antivirals in treatment of hepatitis C. This is the first case report of an adolescent with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 4 infection and cirrhosis who failed treatment with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and ribavirin. Resistance analysis showed baseline resistance-associated substitutions M28V and Y93C and emergent D168H.\",\"These updated guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Community of Practice of the American Society of Transplantation review the diagnosis, prevention, and management of viral hepatitis in the pre- and post-transplant period. The current guidelines reflect the declining need for hepatitis B immunoglobulin following liver transplant, now replaced with nucleos(t)ide analogues that effectively suppress viral replication for the long term with minimal risk for drug resistance. It describes the limitations of pegylated interferon alpha in the treatment for chronic hepatitis D. The guidelines feature the paradigm shift in the treatment arena of chronic hepatitis C, now consisting of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medications that effect a cure almost universally. Its safety profile and easy tolerance have permitted its use in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and/or end-stage renal disease. The high potency of the DAA's has fueled the rapidly expanding utilization of hepatitis C-exposed grafts in non-hepatitis C-infected liver, heart, or kidney recipients within structured protocols, followed by viral eradication with DAA therapy in the peri- or post-transplant period. Chronic hepatitis E has become more recognized in the solid-organ transplant recipients, and the therapeutic approach has been streamlined to start with reduction of immunosuppression, and if indicated afterward, ribavirin monotherapy.\",\"Cancer therapies are plagued by resistance. Previously, we discovered a novel form of cancer drug resistance where the Glioma-associated protein 1 (GLI1) elevates UGT1A glucuronidation enzymes, thereby glucuronidating cytarabine and ribavirin, leading to resistance in leukemia patients. Here, we demonstrate that GLI1 imparts resistance to \\u223c40 compounds, including FDA-approved drugs with disparate chemotypes (e.g., methotrexate and venetoclax). GLI1 indirectly elevates UGT1As via the chaperone calreticulin, which is required for resistance. Further, we demonstrate that resistant cells are more sensitive to ATP inhibitors, suggesting an Achilles' heel, which could be exploited in the future. In all, we identify GLI1-inducible glucuronidation as a broad-spectrum multidrug resistance pathway.\",\"Ribavirin is a broad-spectrum nucleoside-derived antiviral drug used in combination pharmacotherapy treatment of hepatitis C virus infection. Current evidence indicates that ribavirin-associated teratogenicity is not significant in humans, but more information about the developmental toxicity and mechanisms involved in ribavirin placental kinetics is required to assure its safe use in pregnancy. Thus, we have investigated potential roles of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs, SLC29A), Na[+]-dependent influx-mediating concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs, SLC28A), and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux pumps, in ribavirin placental pharmacokinetics. Our data indicate that ENT1 participates in uptake of ribavirin by BeWo cells, fresh human placental villous fragments and microvillous plasma membrane (MVM) vesicles while activity of CNTs (probably CNT2) was only observed in BeWo cells. In situ dual perfusion experiments with rat term placenta in an open circuit setup showed that ENT inhibition significantly decreases total ribavirin maternal-to-foetal and foetal-to-maternal clearances. In contrast, no contribution of ABC transporters, p-glycoprotein (ABCB1), breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2), or multidrug resistance-associated protein (ABCC2) was detected in assays with MDCKII cells overexpressing them, or in closed circuit dual perfusion experiments with rat term placenta. In summary, our data show that ribavirin placental pharmacokinetics are largely controlled by ENT1 activity and independent of ABCB1, ABCG2, and ABCC2 efflux pumps.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects approx. 3% of the world's population and accounts for ca 300 000 deaths per year. 80% of individuals with HCV develop chronic symptoms which, when untreated, may cause cirrhosis (27%) or hepatocellular carcinoma (25%). The hepatitis C virus is a (+)ssRNA enveloped virus of the family Flaviviridae. Seven major HCV genotypes and their subtypes (a, b) have been identified. In the 1990s, interferons alpha-2 were used in the treatment of HCV and in the next decade HCV therapy was based on pegylated interferon alpha-2 in combination with ribavirin. Since 2011, interferons alpha, DNA and RNA polymerase inhibitors, NS3/4A RNA protease inhibitors, NS5 RNA serine protease inhibitors, NS5B RNA polymerase inhibitors have been approved for clinical use. Monotherapy is avoided in medication due to rapidly developing viral resistance. A total of 113 papers were included comprising original publications and reviews. The paper reviews the molecular targets and chemical structures of drugs used in HCV treatment. Indications and contraindications for anti-HCV drugs are also discussed together with application regimens.\",\"The emergence of a deletion mutant at hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A-P32 (P32del) has recently been reported in a subset of chronic hepatitis C patients who experience virologic failure after direct-acting antiviral drug (DAA) treatment. This mutation confers extremely high resistance to NS5A inhibitors. No effective treatment has been established for cases with this mutation.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus infection and associated hepatic diseases are still challenging, and the disease burden remains significant around the world. Overall treatment rates for the chronically infected patients have been \\\"dismally poor\\\" and that treatment completion of dual-therapy- pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) is suboptimal in the real-world clinical settings. The approval of first, second and next-generation direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) represents a major breakthrough in hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapeutics to treat CHC infected individuals. Such therapeutic regimens in a fixed dose combination (FDC) or along with RBV have proven their clinical efficacy against different HCV genotypes, and harder-to-treat special populations. We continue to see the development of novel pan-genotypic anti-HCV regimens with very high sustained virologic response (SVR; undetectable viral load at week 12 or at the end of therapy) rates, high barrier to drug resistance, low frequency of adverse events, and fewer drug-drug interactions as compared to some older RBV based triple DAA therapies. Oral interferon-free DAAs seem highly successful strategic treatment approaches against hepatitis C and impulse health policy makers to establish the treatment priorties and policies to reduce the rate of hepatitis C-related morbidity and mortality. This review article comprehensively overviews interferon-free anti-HCV regimens, which have totally shifted the treatment paradigms for hepatitis C with some additional benefits to galvanize our efforts to achieve the global goal of HCV elimination in near future.\",\"Approximately 650,000 people in Brazil have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of ombitasvir (OBV)/paritaprevir (PTV)/ritonavir (r) plus dasabuvir (DSV) with/without ribavirin (RBV) in an openlabel multicenter phase 3b trial in treatment-naive or interferon (IFN) treatment-experienced Brazilian patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis (METAVIR F3/4) and HCV genotype (GT) 1 infection.\",\"Intergenotypic recombinant hepatitis C virus (HCV) strains emerge rarely during coinfection of the same individual with two HCV genotypes. Few recombinant HCV strains have been identified to date and only one, CRF01 2k/1b, has become a worldwide concern. This study reevaluated the genotyping of three HCV genotype 2 strains from a group of patients with an unusually low rate of sustained virological response after pegylated interferon/ribavirin treatment. In addition, genetic determinants of host interferon resistance were evaluated.\",\"To describe factors associated with treatment failure and frequency of resistance-associated substitutions (RAS).\",\"Treatment with daclatasvir plus asunaprevir (DCV + ASV) for 24 weeks provided a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate of over 90% in hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (HCV-1b) infected patients without non-structural 5A (NS5A) resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) at the L31 and Y93 sites. In this study, we investigated whether adding ribavirin to the DCV + ASV combination could shorten the original treatment regimen to 12 weeks without compromising the treatment efficacy for HCV-1b patients without NS5A RASs.\",\"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of community-based ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus ribavirin therapy for non-cirrhotic patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2a infection in a real-world setting.\",\"The poor outcomes in infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) necessitate new treatments. Here we discover that EIF4E protein is elevated in most cases of infant ALL and test EIF4E targeting by the repurposed antiviral agent ribavirin, which has anticancer properties through EIF4E inhibition, as a potential treatment. We find that ribavirin treatment of actively dividing infant ALL cells on bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) at clinically achievable concentrations causes robust proliferation inhibition in proportion with EIF4E expression. Further, we find that ribavirin treatment of KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-R) infant ALL cells and the KMT2A-AFF1 cell line RS4:11 inhibits EIF4E, leading to decreases in oncogenic EIF4E-regulated cell growth and survival proteins. In ribavirin-sensitive KMT2A-R infant ALL cells and RS4:11 cells, EIF4E-regulated proteins with reduced levels of expression following ribavirin treatment include MYC, MCL1, NBN, BCL2 and BIRC5. Ribavirin-treated RS4:11 cells exhibit impaired EIF4E-dependent nuclear to cytoplasmic export and/or translation of the corresponding mRNAs, as well as reduced phosphorylation of the p-AKT1, p-EIF4EBP1, p-RPS6 and p-EIF4E signaling proteins. This leads to an S-phase cell cycle arrest in RS4:11 cells corresponding to the decreased proliferation. Ribavirin causes nuclear EIF4E to re-localize to the cytoplasm in KMT2A-AFF1 infant ALL and RS4:11 cells, providing further evidence for EIF4E inhibition. Ribavirin slows increases in peripheral blasts in KMT2A-R infant ALL xenograft-bearing mice. Ribavirin cooperates with chemotherapy, particularly L-asparaginase, in reducing live KMT2A-AFF1 infant ALL cells in BMSC co-cultures. This work establishes that EIF4E is broadly elevated across infant ALL and that clinically relevant ribavirin exposures have preclinical activity and effectively inhibit EIF4E in KMT2A-R cases, suggesting promise in EIF4E targeting using ribavirin as a means of treatment.\",\"Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) permit the use of interferon (IFN)-free regimens to treat hepatitis C (HCV) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemo-dialysis (HD) or renal transplant (RTx) recipients, with excellent response rates and safety. However, the occurrence of basal or therapy-induced resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) to DAAs can result in treatment failure. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of RASs to NS3A, NS5A and NS5B inhibitors, and particularly the Q80K polymorphism, in CKD patients on HD and RTx recipients infected with HCV.\",\"According to the EASL and AASLD guidelines, the recommended treatment for patients who failed to achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR) on prior interferon-based triple therapy with protease inhibitors (PI), is a combination of sofosbuvir and NS5A inhibitors. Polish national recommendations also allow the use of paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir+dasasbuvir\\u00b1ribavirin (PrODR) in this group of patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PrODR vs. ledipasvir/sofosbuvir\\u00b1RBV (LSR) in PI-experienced patients in real-life setting.\",\"The introduction of new multi-genotypic direct acting antivirals (DAA) in clinical practice has revolutionized HCV treatment, permitting the achievement of >95% rates of sustained virological response in many patients. However, virological failures can occur particularly if the treatments are sub optimal and/or with too short duration. Failure is often associated with development of resistance. The wide genetic variability in terms of different genotypes and subtypes, together with the natural presence and/or easy development of resistance during treatment, are intrinsic characteristics of HCV that may affect the treatment outcome and the chances of achieving a virological cure. This review explores in detail the aspects of HCV innate and treatment-induced resistance to new interferon-free DAA regimens.\",\"European treatment guidelines for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection recommend that people with genotype (GT) 1a infection and baseline viral load \\u2264800 000 IU/mL receive elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) for 12 weeks, and those with baseline viral load >800 000 IU/mL receive EBR/GZR plus ribavirin for 16 weeks. This analysis was conducted to clarify whether baseline viral load can serve as an accurate, sensitive or specific stratification factor for defining EBR/GZR regimens. In this post hoc, integrated analysis, participants with GT1a infection who received EBR 50 mg/GZR 100 mg for 12 weeks were stratified according to baseline viral load. Sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment was achieved by 95.2% (911/957) of participants and was higher among participants with baseline viral load \\u2264800 000 IU/mL vs >800 000 IU/mL (98.5% vs 93.9%). The 800 000 IU/mL threshold had a positive predictive value of 98.5%, a negative predictive value of 6.1%, a specificity of 91.3%, a sensitivity of 28.4% and an overall accuracy of 31.5%. A baseline viral load cutpoint of 800 000 IU/mL had high positive predictive value and specificity but poor negative predictive value, sensitivity and accuracy in predicting treatment outcomes in this population. Baseline NS5A resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) were detected in 25% (1/4) of virologic failures with baseline viral load \\u2264800 000 IU/mL and 59.5% (25/42) of those with baseline viral load >800 000 IU/mL. Overall, these data suggest that, compared with the use of a baseline viral load cutpoint, baseline testing for NS5A RASs enables more individuals to receive the 12-week EBR/GZR regimen without compromising the opportunity for SVR.\",\"In Pakistan, the burden of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the second highest in the world with the development of chronic hepatitis. Interferon-based combination therapy with ribavirin was the only available treatment until a few years back, with severe side-effects and high failure rates against different genotypes of HCV. Interferon-free all-oral direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) approved by the FDA have revolutionized the HCV therapeutic landscape due to their efficiency in targeting different genotypes in different categories of patients, including treatment na\\u00efve, treatment failure and relapsing patients, as well as patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. The availability and use of these DAAs is limited in the developing world. Sofosbuvir (SOF), a uridine nucleotide analogue and inhibitor of HCV encoded NS5B polymerase, is now a widely available and in-use DAA in Pakistan; whereas daclatasvir was recently added in the list. According to the documented results, there is hope that this disease can be effectively cured in Pakistan, although a few concerns still remain. The aim of this article is to review the effectiveness of DAAs and the current status of this treatment against HCV genotype 3 infection in Pakistan; various factors associated with SVR; its limitations as an effective treatment regime; and future implications.\",\"Immunosuppressed individuals can shed influenza virus for prolonged periods of time, leading to the frequent emergence of antiviral resistance. We evaluated the benefits of oseltamivir and favipiravir combination therapy compared to single antiviral agents and monitored the emergence of drug-resistant variants in a pharmacologically immunosuppressed mouse model infected with the A(H1N1) pandemic influenza virus. C57BL/6 mice were immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide and infected with a lethal dose of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus. Forty-eight hours post-infection, mice were treated with oseltamivir (20 mg/kg), favipiravir (20 or 50 mg/kg) or both agents BID for 5 or 10 days. Body weight losses, survival rates, lung viral titers, cytokine levels and emergence of resistant viruses were evaluated. Treatment of immunosuppressed mice with high (50 mg/kg) but not low (20 mg/kg) doses of favipiravir in combination with oseltamivir (20 mg/kg) significantly delayed mortality and reduced lung viral titers compared to treatment with a single drug regimen with oseltamivir but did not prevent the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant H275Y neuraminidase variants. Combination therapy with oseltamivir and favipiravir should be considered for evaluation in clinical trials.\",\"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) can cause chronic infections in immunosuppressed patients with adverse clinical outcomes. Intervention strategies are limited with ribavirin (RBV) being the only main therapeutic option as off-label drug. Recent reports on RBV monotherapy failures show a coherence with the presence of certain single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and in-frame insertions in the hypervariable region of open reading frame 1 in the HEV genome. Importantly, some of the alterations were present in the viral population as minor variant before RBV administration. Individualized infection medicine by early detection of emerging viral variants in patients could improve treatment outcome and prognosis.\",\"The rapid development of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy dramatically altered the treatment landscape of this disease. The DAA regimen is associated with various advantages including high sustained virological response (SVR) with minimum side effects and low pill load and specific inhibition of viral replication, which lowers dependence on the host cell. This regimen has substantially replaced conventional (interferon) therapy with high cure rates (> 90%) in most HCV populations. This review provides insight into clinical studies of NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5B viral polymerase inhibitor (nucleotide and non-nucleotide), and NS5A inhibitors, alone and in combination.\",\"Despite very high efficacies of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) reported in clinical trials, treatment failure in real-life practice can occur in 5-10% of cases and is mostly associated with emergence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs). Little is known about the efficacy of retreatment in these patients, especially in those with decompensated cirrhosis, and only a few retreatment studies have been performed so far. Here we present case reports of successful sofosbuvir-based treatment in patients with advanced class B cirrhosis with prior pegylated interferon/ribavirin and all-oral DAA failure with multiclass drug resistance. HCV resistance testing at failure was performed to guide the choice of salvage therapy.\",\"Influenza viruses (IVs) are a continual threat to global health. The high mutation rate of the IV genome makes this virus incredibly successful, genetic drift allows for annual epidemics which result in thousands of deaths and millions of hospitalizations. Moreover, the emergence of new strains through genetic shift (e.g., swine-origin influenza A) can cause devastating global outbreaks of infection. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are currently used to treat IV infection and act directly on viral proteins to halt IV spread. However, effectivity is limited late in infection and drug resistance can develop. New therapies which target highly conserved features of IV such as antibodies to the stem region of hemagglutinin or the IV RNA polymerase inhibitor: Favipiravir are currently in clinical trials. Compared to NAIs, these treatments have a higher tolerance for resistance and a longer therapeutic window and therefore, may prove more effective. However, clinical and experimental evidence has demonstrated that it is not just viral spread, but also the host inflammatory response and damage to the lung epithelium which dictate the outcome of IV infection. Therapeutic regimens for IV infection should therefore also regulate the host inflammatory response and protect epithelial cells from unnecessary cell death. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as etanercept, statins or cyclooxygenase enzyme 2 inhibitors may temper IV induced inflammation, demonstrating the possibility of repurposing these drugs as single or adjunct therapies for IV infection. IV binds to sialic acid receptors on the host cell surface to initiate infection and productive IV replication is primarily restricted to airway epithelial cells. Accordingly, targeting therapies to the epithelium will directly inhibit IV spread while minimizing off target consequences, such as over activation of immune cells. The neuraminidase mimic Fludase cleaves sialic acid receptors from the epithelium to inhibit IV entry to cells. While type III interferons activate an antiviral gene program in epithelial cells with minimal perturbation to the IV specific immune response. This review discusses the above-mentioned candidate anti-IV therapeutics and others at the preclinical and clinical trial stage.\",\"The use of oral ribavirin (RBV) for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections is not well studied. With the drastic increase in the cost of aerosolized RBV, we aimed to compare outcomes of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients treated with oral or aerosolized RBV for RSV infections.\",\"This study aimed to describe the real-world efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir (SOF) + ribavirin (RBV) for chronic hepatitis C, genotype 2.\",\"A detailed analysis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) is required to understand why people fail direct-acting antiviral therapies. This study was conducted to assess RASs in an analysis of 2 trials evaluating the second-generation NS3/4A protease inhibitor grazoprevir (GZR) in combination with peginterferon/ribavirin.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C remains a major public health concern with a prevalence of more than 1% worldwide. Of late, with the discovery of newer drugs, chronic HCV treatment has touched new dimensions. The treatment has progressed from Interferons to Pegylated interferon (Peg IFN) based therapy, with or without ribavirin to treatment with orally active Direct Acting Antivirals (DAA) with Peg IFN and ribavirin and eventually to various combinations of DAA, without IFN. Introduction of newer DAAs has transfigured the treatment of chronic HCV. Chronic HCV patients with advanced liver disease, psychiatric condition, anemia or autoimmune diseases, not eligible for Peg IFN based therapy have a ray of hope now. Amongst all DAAs, nucleoside inhibitors have been the most promising agent. Thus the present review focuses on Sofosbuvir, one of the most effective nucleoside inhibitors; in terms of potency, resistance profile, activity against all genotypes of HCV and adverse effects. FDA approved Sofobuvir for clinical use in 2013. Chemically, it is 2'-deoxy-2'-\\u03b1-fluoro-\\u03b2-Cmethyluridine- 5'-triphosphate; a phosphoramidate prodrug that is activated by enzyme present in human liver. It is a highly potent inhibitor of HCV NS5B polymerase. Efficacy of the Sofosbuvir has been established in various phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials like PROTON, ELECTRON, FUSION, POSITRON etc. Sofosbuvir has a good safety profile with few mild to moderate adverse effects. Evidence reveals that sofosbuvir has substantial impact on the treatment of HCV.\",\"This study was performed to investigate the efficacy and safety of grazoprevir-elbasvir guided by baseline resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) in the Swiss HCVree Trial.\",\"Viral fitness quantifies the degree of virus adaptation to a given environment. How viral fitness can influence the mutant spectrum complexity of a viral quasispecies subjected to lethal mutagenesis has not been investigated. Here we document that two high fitness hepatitis C virus populations display higher resistance to the mutagenic nucleoside analogues favipiravir and ribavirin than their parental, low fitness HCV. All populations, however, exhibited a mutation transition bias indicative of active mutagenesis. Resistance to the analogues was associated with a limited expansion of mutant spectrum complexity, as evidenced by several diversity indices used to characterize mutant spectra. The results are consistent with a replicative site-drug competition mechanism that was previously proposed for HCV fitness-associated resistance to non-mutagenic inhibitors. Other alternative, non-mutually exclusive mechanisms are considered. The results introduce viral fitness as a relevant parameter to evaluate the response of viruses to lethal mutagenesis, with implications for antiviral designs.\",\"Chronic Hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is associated with extrahepatic manifestations and an increased prevalence in cardiovascular disease. New direct acting antivirals (DAA) have revolutionized HCV treatment with high rates of sustained virological response (SVR). Recently it was demonstrated, that SVR reduces morbidity and overall mortality more than can be solely explained by hepatic effects, suggesting that treatment with DAA also affects cardiovascular disease. The aim of this pilot study was to identify possible underlying mechanisms behind the HCV-associated cardiovascular mortality reported by others.\",\"Currently, there are no interferon-free treatments available for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients younger than 12 years. We evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the all-oral regimen ledipasvir-sofosbuvir \\u00b1 ribavirin in HCV-infected children aged 6 to <12 years. In an open-label study, patients aged 6 to <12 years received ledipasvir 45 mg-sofosbuvir 200 mg as two fixed-dose combination tablets 22.5/100 mg once daily, with or without ribavirin, for 12 or 24 weeks, depending on HCV genotype and cirrhosis status. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virologic response 12 weeks after therapy (SVR12). Twelve patients underwent intensive pharmacokinetic sampling to confirm the appropriateness of the ledipasvir and sofosbuvir dosages. Ninety-two patients were enrolled (88 genotype 1, 2 genotype 3, and 2 genotype 4), with a median age of 9 years (range, 6-11). Most were perinatally infected (97%) and treatment-naive (78%). Two were confirmed to have cirrhosis, while the degree of fibrosis was unknown in 55 patients. The overall SVR12 rate was 99% (91/92; 95% confidence interval, 94%-100%). The single patient not reaching SVR relapsed 4 weeks after completing 12 weeks of treatment. The most common adverse events were headache and pyrexia. One patient had three serious adverse events, which were considered to be not related to study treatment: tooth abscess, abdominal pain, and gastroenteritis. The area under the concentration-time curve and maximum concentration values for sofosbuvir, its primary metabolite GS-331007, and ledipasvir were within predefined pharmacokinetic equivalence boundaries (50%-200%) compared to values in adults in phase 2/3 of the ledipasvir and sofosbuvir studies. Conclusion: Ledipasvir-sofosbuvir was well tolerated and highly effective in children 6 to <12 years old with chronic HCV.\",\"The treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been revolutionized by the development of all-oral combination regimens of direct-acting antiviral agents. The current analysis characterized the relationship between exposures of daclatasvir (DCV; tablets) and asunaprevir (ASV; capsules) and sustained virologic response (SVR) in Japanese patients who are HCV genotype (GT) 1b nonresponders to pegylated interferon (IFN) \\u03b1/ribavirin or IFN\\u03b2/ribavirin, and IFN-based therapy-ineligible naive/intolerant patients receiving DCV and ASV, and provided insight into patient covariates that were most closely associated with efficacy. The relationship between the probability of achieving SVR at 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12) and average steady-state plasma concentrations estimated from population pharmacokinetic models for DCV and ASV is described using a logistic regression model with data from a phase 2 and a phase 3 study in Japanese patients infected with HCV GT 1b (N=265). The functional form characterization, which describes a relationship between DCV and ASV average steady-state plasma concentrations and SVR12, as well as covariate identification (demographic, laboratory, and prognostic and treatment covariates) were investigated during model development. The presence of the signature nonstructural protein 5A Y93H mutation at baseline was the only significant parameter of SVR12 in the final exposure-response model. Model evaluation plots demonstrate that the final model was able to predict the observed SVR rates. Exposure-response analysis supports the clinical utility of the combination regimen of 60-mg once-daily DCV and 100-mg twice-daily ASV in Japanese patients infected with HCV GT 1b.\",\"Over 2,200 patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes (GT) 1 to 6, with or without cirrhosis, who were treatment naive or experienced to interferon, ribavirin, and/or sofosbuvir were treated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8, 12, or 16 weeks in eight registrational phase 2 and 3 clinical studies. High rates of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks postdosing (SVR12) were achieved with a <1% virologic failure (VF) rate. The prevalence of baseline polymorphisms (BPs) in NS3 at amino acid position 155 or 168 was low (<3%) in patients infected with GT1, GT2, GT3, GT4, and GT6, while 41.9% of the GT5-infected patients had NS3-D168E; BPs were not detected at position 156 in NS3. The prevalence of NS5A-BPs was high across genotypes, driven by common polymorphisms at amino acid position 30 or 31 in GT2, 58 in GT4, and 28 in GT6. The prevalence of NS5A T/Y93 polymorphisms was 5.5% in GT1, 4.9% in GT3, and 12.5% in GT6. Consistent with the activity of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir against most amino acid polymorphisms in vitro, BPs in NS3 and/or NS5A did not have an impact on treatment outcome for patients infected with GT1 to GT6, with the exception of treatment-experienced GT3-infected patients treated for 12 weeks, for whom a 16-week regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was required to achieve SVR12 rates of \\u226595%. Among the 22 patients experiencing VF, treatment-emergent substitutions were detected in NS3 in 50% of patients and in NS5A in 82% of patients, frequently as a combination of substitutions that conferred resistance to glecaprevir and/or pibrentasvir. The glecaprevir/pibrentasvir regimen, when the recommended durations are used, allows for a pan-genotypic treatment option without the need for baseline resistance testing.\",\"Insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus are common extrahepatic manifestations of chronic hepatitis C (HCV). Insulin resistance assessed by HOMA-IR is associated with low rates of sustained virological response, especially in HCV genotype 1 positive patients treated with peginterferon/ribavirin. The effect of insulin resistance on sustained virologic response in HCV genotype 3 positive patients who were treated with peginterferon/ribavirin still remains unclear.\",\"In HCV-infected people who fail to achieve sustained virological response after receiving a direct-acting antiviral regimen, virological failure is almost always accompanied by the presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) in the target protein(s). The aim of this long-term observational study was to evaluate the persistence of NS3/4A and NS5A RASs in participants with genotype (GT) 1 infection who relapsed following treatment with a grazoprevir-containing treatment regimen.\",\"In Japan, there is a growing population of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who failed a direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based regimen. In this Phase 3 study, we evaluated sofosbuvir-velpatasvir plus ribavirin in Japanese patients with genotype 1 or 2 HCV infection who previously received DAAs.\",\"Genetic polymorphisms within the interferon \\u03bb (IFN-\\u03bb) chromosomal region, mainly rs12979860 of IFN-\\u03bb4 gene (IFNL4), are known as associated with spontaneous hepatitis C virus (HCV) resolution and sustained viral response to therapy with pegylated interferon- \\u03b1 and ribavirin. Strong linkage disequilibrium of IFNL4 rs12979860 with IFNL4 rs368234815, which is casually associated with HCV spontaneous and therapeutical eradication, at least partially explains favorable HCV outcomes attributed to major homozygosity in rs12979860. Effects of IFN-based antiviral treatment are associated with pretreatment expression of the IFN-\\u03bb1 receptor, expression of hepatic IFN-stimulated genes, production of IFN- \\u03bb4, and preactivation of the JAK-STAT signaling. Nowadays direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) became a potent tool in the treatment of hepatitis C, but IFN-\\u03bbs are still under investigation as potential antivirals and might be an option in HCV infection (DAA resistance, recurrent viremia, adverse effects). Patients with altered immunocompetence are especially prone to infections. In uremic subjects, polymorphisms within the IFN-\\u03bb chromosomal region associate with spontaneous HCV clearance, similarly like in the non-uremic population. Circulating IFN-\\u03bb3 shows a positive correlation with plasma titers of antibodies to surface antigen of hepatitis B virus (anti-HBs), which are crucial for protection against hepatitis B virus. More efficient anti-HBs production in the presence of higher IFN-\\u03bb3 levels might occur due to IFN-\\u03bb3-induced regulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression. IFN-stimulated response element is a part of IDO gene promoter. It is worth further investigation whether IDO gene, circulating IDO, genetic polymorphisms within the IFN-\\u03bb region, and circulating IFN-\\u03bb3 act in concordance in immunological response to hepatotropic viruses.\",\"Insulin resistance (IR) is a common complication in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients. The impact of IR on outcome of therapy with direct antivirals has not been studied.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) exhibits great genetic diversity and is classified into 7 genotypes (GTs), with varied geographic prevalence. Until the recent development of pangenotypic direct-acting antiviral regimens, the determination of HCV GT was necessary to inform optimal treatment.\",\"Although cancer patients initially respond well to chemotherapy, they eventually develop resistance and relapse. In this work, we demonstrate that eIF4E-targeting therapy is a potential sensitizing strategy for overcoming chemoresistance and progression in cancer. We show that ribavirin, an anti-viral drug and pharmacological eIF4E inhibitor, effectively inhibits proliferation and decreases viability of paclitaxel-resistant cervical cancer and 5-FU-resistant colon cancer cells while is less toxic to human fibroblast cells. Importantly, oral administration of ribavirin significantly inhibits paclitaxel-resistant colon and 5-FU-resistant cervical cancer growth in xenograft mouse cancer model without causing significant toxicity in mice. Consistently, combination of ribavirin with paclitaxel or 5-FU sensitizes colon and cervical cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents treatment in vitro and in vivo. We further confirm that the mechanism of the action of ribavirin in chemoresistant cancer cells is through suppressing eIF4E function. In addition, specific eIF4E knockdown via two independent siRNA mimics the effects of ribavirin in chemoresistant colon and cervical cancer cells. Cell cycle analysis indicate that ribavirin enhances the anti-proliferative effect of 5-FU by additionally arresting cells at G2/M phase via increasing cyclin B1, p-histone H3(Ser10) and Mad2 levels. Our work demonstrates that eIF4E inhibition using inhibitor or siRNA, either as single agent or in combination, could sensitize chemoresistant cancer cells to paclitaxel or 5-FU treatment and thereby improving the efficacy of chemodrug. Our findings demonstrate the therapeutic value of inhibiting eIF4E, particularly in chemoresistant cancers. Our findings also suggest ribavirin as a promising sensitizing drug for cancer treatment.\",\"In phase 3 trials and real-world settings, smaller proportions of patients with genotype 3 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and cirrhosis have a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12) with the combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir than in patients without cirrhosis. It is unclear whether adding ribavirin to this treatment regimen increases SVRs in patients with genotype 3 HCV infection and cirrhosis.\",\"Ribavirin (RBV) has been used for the last 20 years to treat patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This pluripotent drug is believed to induce mutagenesis in HCV RNA. However, for cell-cultured HCV (HCVcc) this phenomenon has only been investigated in genotype 2a recombinants. Here we studied the mutations that developed in HCVcc of genotypes 1a and 3a treated with RBV or ribavirin triphosphate (RBV-TP) compared to non-treated controls. Analysis was performed on the amplified full-length open reading frame (ORF) of recovered viruses following next-generation sequencing and clonal analyses. Compared to non-treated controls, the spread of TNcc(1a) and DBN3acc(3a) HCVcc was delayed by RBV and RBV-TP at concentrations of 40 \\u00b5M or higher. The delay in HCVcc spread was associated with increased new single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Significantly higher numbers of new SNP were observed in TNcc(1a) viruses treated with RBV or RBV-TP compared to matched non-treated controls. RBV or RBV-TP treatment led to significantly increased proportions of new G-to-A and C-to-U SNP compared to non-treated TNcc(1a). Clonal analyses confirmed a significantly increased mutation rate in RBV-treated TNcc(1a). Synonymous pairwise distances increased in both viruses across the complete ORF under RBV and RBV-TP treatment compared to controls. Consensus-shifts in single samples of RBV- or RBV-TP-treated TNcc(1a) viruses occurred in proteins E1, p7, NS3 and NS4B. No non-synonymous consensus changes were observed in DBN3acc(3a). This study supports a biased G-to-A and C-to-U mutagenic effect of RBV and RBV-TP throughout the entire ORF of HCV genotypes 1a and 3a.\",\"In hepatitis C virus (HCV), infection viral and IL28B genotype along with many clinical and biochemical factors can influence response rates to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (Peg-IFN-a/R) therapy and progression to chronic hepatitis C (CHC).\",\"Influenza A virus (IAV) causes seasonal epidemics and occasional but devastating pandemics, which are major public health concerns. Because the effectiveness of seasonal vaccines is highly variable and the currently available drugs are limited in their efficacy because of the emergence of drug resistance, there is an urgent need to develop novel antivirals. In this study, we characterized a recombinant IAV-carrying Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) gene and determined its potential as a tool for evaluating therapeutics. We demonstrated that this recombinant IAV is replication-competent in tissue culture and pathogenic in mice, although it is slightly attenuated compared to the parental virus. Luciferase expression correlated well with virus propagation both in vitro and in vivo, providing a simple measure for viral replication in tissue culture and in mouse lungs. To demonstrate the utility of this virus, ribavirin and oseltamivir phosphate were used to treat the IAV-infected cells and mice, and we observed the dose-dependent inhibition of viral replication by a luciferase assay. Moreover, the decreased luciferase expression in the infected lungs could predict the protective efficacy of antiviral interventions as early as day 2 post virus challenge. In summary, this study provides a new and quantitative approach to evaluate antivirals against IAV.\",\"Trichomonas vaginalis infects approximately 300 million people worldwide annually. Infected individuals have a higher susceptibility to more serious conditions such as cervical and prostate cancer. The parasite has developed increasing resistance to current drug therapies, with an estimated 5% of clinical cases resulting from resistant strains, creating the need for new therapeutic strategies with novel mechanisms of action. Nucleoside salvage pathway enzymes represent novel drug targets as these pathways are essential for the parasite's survival. The guanosine/adenosine/cytidine nucleoside hydrolase (GACNH) may be particularly important as its expression is upregulated under glucose-limiting conditions mimicking those that occur during infection establishment. GACNH was screened against the NIH Clinical Collection to explore its druggability. Seven compounds were identified with IC50 values <20 \\u03bcM. Extensive overlap was found between inhibitors of GACNH and the adenosine/guanosine nucleoside hydrolase (AGNH), but no overlap was found with inhibitors of the uridine nucleoside hydrolase. The guanosine analog ribavirin was the only compound found to be specific for GACNH. Compounds that inhibit both AGNH and GACNH purine salvage pathway enzymes may prove critical given the role that GACNH appears to play in the early stages of infection.\",\"The landscape of therapeutic options for HCV infection has dramatically changed with the approval of all-oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens. DAAs target important steps in the HCV viral life cycle, resulting in higher response rates and fewer adverse events than were afforded with interferon and ribavirin, the prior standard of care. The achievement of sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in excess of 90% with use of DAA regimens has not only translated into HCV eradication for the hundreds of thousands treated but is also anticipated to decrease the incidence of major complications associated with chronic HCV infection. Additionally, the favorable side effect profile of DAAs has made HCV therapy feasible in difficult-to-treat populations, including those with previous exposure to interferon and ribavirin, cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, HIV and HCV co-infection, and severe renal dysfunction/end stage renal disease. Given this tremendous progress, all patients infected with HCV infection should be treated.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) has a prevalence rate of 0.43% in China and approximately 10 million chronically infected people are in urgent need of treatment. Since the beginning of 2013, pan-genotypic sofosbuvir (SOF) with its potent antiviral activity, minimal drug resistance, less drug-drug interactions and good safety has created a new era in HCV treatment. Its combination with ribavirin, in single tablet regimen with either ledipasvir or velpatasvir has been widely used in about 1.6 million patients worldwide. Furthermore, SOF-based therapy is proven to be effective and safe in serious or terminal illness such as decompensated cirrhosis, liver or kidney transplantation, HIV or HBV co-infections, bleeding disorders, intravenous drug users, adolescents, and elderly. Therefore, SOF-based regimens would fill the unmet medical needs of our patients with HCV.\",\"Search for new antiviral and anticancer agents are essential because of the emergence of drug resistance in recent years. In continuation of our efforts in identifying the new small molecule antiviral and anticancer agents, we identified chalcones as potent antiviral and anticancer agents.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a unique virus which interacts with cholesterol, iron and insulin metabolism. There is limited data on the effects of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) on metabolic profiles. We aimed at evaluating the behavior of metabolic risk factors of chronically HCV-infected patients after sustained virologic response (SVR), comparing the outcomes with the new DAAs versus the old treatment regimen Peg-interferon \\u00b1 ribavirin.\",\"Familial Mediterranean fever is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by periodic febrile attacks of aseptic serositis and/or arthritis. The main treatment is colchicine which prevents attacks in the majority of patients except for a group of colchicine-resistant cases. Chronic hepatitis C is a viral infection causing chronic inflammation of liver tissue (hepatitis) which ultimately progresses to fibrosis and liver cirrhosis with a high chance of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, we found no data in the literature concerning the impact of hepatitis C on the course of attacks of familial Mediterranean fever.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection impacts approximately 71 million people and approximately 400,000 deaths are attributed to HCV-related liver disease annually worldwide. Mainstay of treatment for over 25 years has been pegylated interferon until the advent of protease inhibitors, which has led to all-oral HCV treatment regimens that have changed the outlook of hepatitis C treatment. Grazoprevir/elbasvir provides high rates of efficacy and tolerability and is an all-oral once daily treatment option for HCV infection. Efficacy of grazoprevir/elbasvir has been proven in patients with cirrhosis, patients who have previously failed treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin (RBV), patients with end-stage renal disease and patients with HIV co-infection. Data have shown a high barrier to resistance despite the presence of resistance-associated substitutions. Grazoprevir/elbasvir represents a very promising regimen for treatment of HCV infection. This review provides a summary of pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of grazoprevir/elbasvir for the treatment of HCV infection.\",\"A series of dithioacetal derivatives bearing a strobilurin moiety were designed and synthesized on the basis of our previous work. The antiviral activities of these compounds against Potato virus Y (PVY), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were systematically evaluated. Bioassay results indicated that C14 elicited excellent curative and protective activities against PVY, CMV, and TMV. The former had 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of 125.3, 108.9, and 181.7 \\u03bcg/mL, respectively, and the latter had 148.4, 113.2, and 214.6 \\u03bcg/mL, respectively, which were significantly superior to those of lead compound 6f (297.6, 259.6, and 582.4 \\u03bcg/mL and 281.5, 244.3, and 546.3 \\u03bcg/mL, respectively), Ningnanmycin (440.5, 549.1, and 373.8 \\u03bcg/mL and 425.3, 513.3, and 242.7 \\u03bcg/mL, respectively), Chitosan oligosaccharide (553.4, 582.8, and 513.8 \\u03bcg/mL and 547.3, 570.6, and 507.9 \\u03bcg/mL, respectively), and Ribavirin (677.4, 690.3, and 686.5 \\u03bcg/mL and 652.7, 665.4, and 653.4 \\u03bcg/mL, respectively). Moreover, defensive enzyme activities and RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that the antiviral activity was associated with the changes of SOD, CAT, and POD activities in tobacco, which was proved by the related proteins of abscisic acid signaling pathway. This work provided a basis for further design, structural modification, and development of dithioacetal derivatives as new antiviral agents.\",\"Genetic variants at the interferon lambda (IFNL) locus have been associated with several human phenotypes in both disease and health. In chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, where the IFNL variants were first identified to be associated with response to interferon-\\u03b1-ribavirin therapy, the available data clearly suggests that the causal variant could be the dinucleotide polymorphism rs368234815 that causes an open reading frame-shift in the IFNL4 gene resulting in expression of a functional IFN-\\u03bb4, a new type III IFN. In other human diseases/phenotypes where IFNL variants have been recently associated with, the causal mechanism remains unclear. In vitro evidence has shown that other IFNL variants (rs28416813, rs4803217) may regulate expression of another type III IFN, IFN-\\u03bb3. Therefore, expression of a functional IFN-\\u03bb4 and quantitative differences in IFN-\\u03bb3 expression are two potential causal mechanisms behind the observed phenotypes. Since these two potential causal mechanisms involve features of mutual exclusivity and overlapping functions, it is difficult to differentiate one from the other, in vivo, in absence of other implicating evidences. In addition, the strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) observed in many populations at the IFNL locus makes it difficult to tease out the actual functional/causal variants responsible for the phenotypes. The non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism rs117648444 that alters the activity of IFN-\\u03bb4 and the LD structure in the IFNL region which leads to a confounding effect of rs117648444 on other IFNL variants, provide us with additional tools in case-control studies to probe the role of IFN-\\u03bb4.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) and downstream innate immune responses. This study investigated whether baseline and on-treatment differences in these responses predict response versus virological breakthrough during therapy with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Thirteen HCV genotype 1b-infected patients who had previously failed a course of pegylated IFN/ribavirin were retreated with asunaprevir/daclatasvir for 24 weeks. After pretreatment biopsy, patients were randomized to undergo a second biopsy at week 2 or 4 on therapy. Microarray and NanoString analyses were performed on paired liver biopsies and analyzed using linear mixed models. As biomarkers for peripheral IFN responses, peripheral blood natural killer cells were assessed for phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (pSTAT1) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression and degranulation. Nine of 13 (69%) patients achieved sustained virological response at 12 weeks off therapy (SVR12), and 4 experienced virological breakthroughs between weeks 4 and 12. Patients who achieved SVR12 displayed higher ISG expression levels in baseline liver biopsies and a higher frequency of pSTAT1 and TRAIL-expressing, degranulating natural killer cells in baseline blood samples than those who experienced virological breakthrough. Comparing gene expression levels from baseline and on-therapy biopsies, 408 genes (\\u00b11.2-fold, P < 0.01) were differentially expressed. Genes down-regulated on treatment were predominantly ISGs. Down-regulation of ISGs was rapid and correlated with HCV RNA suppression. Conclusion: An enhanced IFN signature is observed at baseline in liver and blood of patients who achieve SVR12 compared to those who experience a virological breakthrough; the findings suggest that innate immunity may contribute to clearance of HCV during DAA therapy by preventing the emergence of resistance-associated substitutions that lead to viral breakthrough during DAA therapy.\",\"Among patients with chronic hepatitis C, 20-30% develop cirrhosis and its complications within 30 years. The antiviral treatment of hepatitis C has become interferon-free, with resulting improvements in sustained virological response rates, safety and tolerability and a shorter duration of treatment.\",\"Data are limited regarding the effectiveness and safety of generic velpatasvir plus sofosbuvir (VEL/SOF) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in patients with or without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection.\",\"In the past few years, a growing body of clinical evidence has highlighted the risk of vitamin D deficiency in patients with chronic hepatitis C and that vitamin D levels are associated with the course of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, adverse effects, and treatment response to peginterferon/ribavirin. Recently, studies have found that vitamin D status is related to drug resistance and increased risk of infection in patients with liver cirrhosis. Vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms have been found to explain the interactions between vitamin D deficiency and HCV infection, offering a new perspective toward understanding the current problems such as the development of insulin resistance and racial differences in sustained virological response. Studies have been conducted to determine whether vitamin D supplementation as an adjuvant yields a better result compared with traditional HCV treatment. Here, we provide a brief review of the past and present knowledge of vitamin D in HCV infection.\",\"Curative interferon and ribavirin sparing treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients require a combination of mechanistically orthogonal direct acting antivirals. A shared component of these treatments is usually an HCV NS5A inhibitor. First generation FDA approved treatments, including the component NS5A inhibitors, do not exhibit equivalent efficacy against HCV virus genotypes 1-6. In particular, these first generation NS5A inhibitors tend to select for viral drug resistance. Ombitasvir is a first generation HCV NS5A inhibitor included as a key component of Viekira Pak for the treatment of patients with HCV genotype 1 infection. Since the launch of next generation HCV treatments, functional cure for genotype 1-6 HCV infections has been achieved, as well as shortened treatment duration across a wider spectrum of genotypes. In this paper, we show how we have modified the anchor, linker, and end-cap architecture of our NS5A inhibitor design template to discover a next generation NS5A inhibitor pibrentasvir (ABT-530), which exhibits potent inhibition of the replication of wild-type genotype 1-6 HCV replicons, as well as improved activity against replicon variants demonstrating resistance against first generation NS5A inhibitors.\",\"To assess daclatasvir plus asunaprevir (DUAL) in treatment-na\\u00efve patients from mainland China, Russia and South Korea with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b infection.\",\"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) has affected an estimated of 80 million individuals worldwide and is a strain on public health. Around 25-30% of patients in Europe and the US who are infected with HIV are coinfected with HCV. Prior to 2013, treatment modalities containing an NS3/4A protease inhibitor in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin improved sustained virological response (SVR) rates. However, rates of severe side effects were high. Nowadays, oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) combination therapy offers excellent treatment efficacy, safety and tolerability.\",\"We report a real-life 3D therapy failure in a patient treated with ombitasvir (OMV)/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir without ribavirin (3D-R). He had therapy failure at week 12 after the end of treatment. We detected resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) plus polymorphisms on NS3, NS5A, and NS5B target regions by population sequencing (15% cut-off) at baseline, at relapse and during follow-up. About this, NS5A RASs generally persist longer than resistances in the other target genes and may impact treatment outcome. Therefore, to evaluate OMV drug-resistance mechanism, we studied the acquired RAS plus polymorphisms on NS5A phosphoprotein by computational studies. OMV showed a higher affinity towards baseline and 93H/108 K mutant structure (follow-up) with respect to 93H/R108 mutant structure (relapse) on phosphoprotein. By Molecular Dynamics simulations (MDs), structural information about the protein stability in presence of OMV were observed. According to our data, molecular modeling approach has proved to be a powerful method to evaluate the impact of these RASs plus specific amino acid (AA) changes on phosphoprotein.\",\"Ribavirin (RBV) is a broad-spectrum antiviral active against a wide range of RNA viruses. Despite having been used for decades in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the precise mechanism of action of RBV is unknown. In other viruses, it inhibits propagation by increasing the rate of G-to-A and C-to-U transitions. Here, we utilized the J6/JFH1 HCV cell-culture system to investigate whether RBV inhibits HCV through the same mechanism. Infected Huh7.5 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of RBV or its phosphorylated forms. A fragment of the HCV NS5B-polymerase gene was amplified, cloned, and sequenced to estimate genetic distances. We confirm that the antiviral effect of all three RBV-drug forms on HCV relies on induction of specific transitions (G-to-A and C-to-U). These mutations lead to generation of non-infectious virions, reflected by decreased spread of HCV in cell culture despite relatively limited effect on virus genome titers. Moreover, treatment experiments conducted on a novel Huh7.5 cell line stably overexpressing adenosine kinase, a key enzyme for RBV activation, yielded comparable results. This study indicates that RBV action on HCV in hepatoma cell-culture is exerted through increase in mutagenesis, mediated by RBV triphosphate, and leading to production of non-infectious viruses.\",\"The clinical experience with protease-inhibitor (PI) triple regimen appears disappointing regarding effect, side effects, high work load, and costs. This real-world study evaluates baseline and emerging resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) and their significance for treatment outcome.\",\"Twelve weeks of the pangenotypic direct-acting antiviral (DAA) combination sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) was highly efficient in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 (GT3) infection in the ASTRAL-3 approval study. However, presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) in the HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) was associated with lower treatment response.\",\"Favipiravir, also known as T-705, is an antiviral drug that has been approved in 2014 in Japan to treat pandemic influenza virus infections. The drug is converted intracellularly into its active, phosphoribosylated form, which is recognized as a substrate by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Interestingly, besides its anti-influenza virus activity, this molecule is also able to inhibit the replication of flavi-, alpha-, filo-, bunya-, arena-, noro-, and of other RNA viruses, which include neglected and (re)emerging viruses for which no antiviral therapy is currently available. We will discuss the potential of favipiravir as a broad-spectrum countermeasure against infections caused by such neglected RNA viruses. Favipiravir has already been used off-label to treat patients infected with the Ebola virus and the Lassa virus. Because of the particular set-up of the clinical trials during these outbreaks, clear conclusions on the efficacy of favipiravir could not be made. For several viruses, it was demonstrated that the barrier of resistance development against favipiravir is high. Favipiravir has been shown to be well tolerated in healthy volunteers and in influenza virus-infected patients; however, caution is needed because of the teratogenic risks of this molecule. Because of its antiviral activity against different RNA viruses and its high barrier for resistance, the potential of favipiravir as a broad-spectrum antiviral seems promising, but safety and potency issues should be overcome before this drug or similar molecules could be used to treat large patient groups.\",\"Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe disease in humans, but no approved therapeutics are available. The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity. We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model. However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs. Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC50) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC50 The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe human infections, but there are no approved antivirals to treat these infections. Development of nucleoside-based therapeutics for CoV infections has been hampered by the presence of a proofreading exoribonuclease. Here, we expand the known efficacy of the nucleotide prodrug remdesivir (GS-5734) to include a group \\u03b2-2a CoV. Further, GS-5734 potently inhibits CoVs with intact proofreading. Following selection with the GS-5734 parent nucleoside, 2 amino acid substitutions in the nsp12 polymerase at residues that are identical across CoVs provide low-level resistance to GS-5734. The resistance mutations decrease viral fitness of MHV in vitro and attenuate pathogenesis in a SARS-CoV animal model of infection. Together, these studies define the target of GS-5734 activity and demonstrate that resistance is difficult to select, only partial, and impairs fitness and virulence of MHV and SARS-CoV, supporting further development of GS-5734 as a potential effective pan-CoV antiviral.\",\"Sofosbuvir is a potent nucleotide HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor that is also a P-glycoprotein (encoded by the ABCB1 gene) and breast cancer resistance protein (encoded by the ABCG2 gene) substrate.

The high cost of DAAs is the main limiting factor for universal treatment of HCV. However, there is a strong evidence that treatment of infection at the early stage of disease may be the most rewarding approach. Areas covered: This review evaluates the aspects underlying the benefit of treating chronic HCV infection at the early stage of disease. It outlines the considerations that have to be taken into account when planning treatment in patients with HCV and minimal liver disease, assessing the positive reflex of viral eradication on several HCV-associated extra-hepatic conditions such as the risk of lymphoma, insulin-resistance and glycaemic control, and renal function. Lastly, it also covers the improvement of patients' quality of life and the pharmaco-economic aspects associated with early treatment. Expert commentary: Treatment of patients with HCV and minimal liver disease is associated with a beneficial, pleiotropic effect of viral eradication that goes beyond the simplistic consideration of the improvement in liver disease-related outcomes.\",\"Following the approval of two new therapeutic combinations within the European Union in 2017, the former Swedish recommendations for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection from 2016 were deemed in need of updating.\",\"Background The epidemic of acute HCV infection among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) is ongoing. Transmission of drug-resistant variants (DRVs) after HCV treatment failure could pose a major threat to the effectiveness of future therapies. We determined the baseline prevalence of pre-existing DRVs in the HCV NS3 protease gene and their effects on the addition of telaprevir (TVR) to standard pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) for acute HCV infection in individuals enrolled in a multicentre randomized controlled trial (2013 and 2014). Methods The HCV NS3 viral protease was analyzed using Sanger and next-generation sequencing (NGS) for DRVs at baseline (n = 31), and at viral breakthrough following TVR-based treatment (n = 3) or PEG-IFN/RBV alone (n = 2). Results Sequence analysis indicated that all individuals were infected with HCV genotype 1a. Complete (100%) concordance was seen between Sanger and NGS for high levels of mutant viral populations. The simeprevir-associated Q80K variant was present at high frequency in the German samples (7/11-64%) and infrequently in the UK samples (1/20-5%). In the three TVR-based treatment failures, V36M/l and R155K/T emerged, but not R155G which was detectable at low levels in two individuals at baseline. Failure rate at week 24 was 26.7% (with baseline DRVs) vs. 6.3% (without baseline DRVs), p = 0.17). Comparison of sequences pre- and post-therapy in 5 who failed therapy revealed the emergence of not previously described variants V193G, E176K, P189S (on TVR), and V181S in one instance each. Conclusion The presence of baseline DRVs for the NS3 protease gene of HCV genotype 1a did not appear to predict treatment failure in our patient cohort. Where detected, Q80K was present at high levels (>98%), but had no effect on outcomes and remained high after failure.\",\"Many direct-acting antiviral regimens have reduced activity in people with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 3 infection and cirrhosis. The C-ISLE study assessed the efficacy and safety of elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) plus sofosbuvir (SOF) with and without ribavirin (RBV) in compensated cirrhotic participants with GT3 infection. This was a phase 2, randomized, open-label study. Treatment-naive participants received EBR/GZR + SOF + RBV for 8 weeks or EBR/GZR + SOF for 12 weeks, and peginterferon/RBV treatment-experienced participants received EBR/GZR + SOF \\u00b1 RBV for 12 weeks or EBR/GZR + SOF for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was HCV RNA <15 IU/mL 12 weeks after the end of treatment (sustained virologic response at 12 weeks [SVR12]). Among treatment-naive participants, SVR12 was 91% (21/23) in those treated with RBV for 8 weeks and 96% (23/24) in those treated for 12 weeks. Among treatment-experienced participants, SVR12 was 94% (17/18) and 100% (17/17) in the 12-week arm, with and without RBV, respectively, and 94% (17/18) in the 16-week arm. Five participants failed to achieve SVR: 2 relapsed (both in the 8-week arm), 1 discontinued due to vomiting/cellulitis (16-week arm), and 2 discontinued (consent withdrawn/lost to follow-up). SVR12 was not affected by the presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs). There was no consistent change in insulin resistance, and 5 participants reported serious adverse events (pneumonia, chest pain, opiate overdose, cellulitis, decreased creatinine). High efficacy was demonstrated in participants with HCV GT3 infection and cirrhosis. Treatment beyond 12 weeks was not required, and efficacy was maintained regardless of baseline RASs.\",\"Elevated liver enzymes are frequently observed in renal transplant recipients and warrant further exploration. In immunosuppressed patients, hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection may cause chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and extrahepatic manifestations such as renal injury.\",\"The aim of this integrated analysis was to assess the efficacy of the once-daily combination of elbasvir 50 mg and grazoprevir 100 mg, with and without ribavirin in HCV genotype 4 (GT4)-infected participants enrolled in the Phase 2/3 clinical programme with elbasvir/grazoprevir.\",\"Baseline resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) have variable impacts in clinical trials but their prevalence and impact in real-world patients remains unclear. We performed baseline resistance testing using a commercial assay (10% cutoff) for 486 patients treated with LDV/SOF or SMV/SOF, with or without ribavirin, in the multi-center, observational HCV-TARGET cohort. Linkage of RASs was evaluated in selected samples using a novel quantitative single variant sequencing assay. Our results showed that the prevalence of NS3, NS5A, NS5B RASs was 45%, 13%, and 8%, respectively, and 10% of patients harbored RASs in 2 or more drug classes. Baseline LDV RASs in GT1a, TE, and cirrhosis LDV/SOF subgroup was associated with 2-4% lower SVR12 rates. SMV RASs was associated with lower SVR12 rates in GT1a, treatment-experienced, cirrhotics SMV/SOF subgroup. Pooled analysis of all patients with baseline RASs revealed that SVR12 was 100% (19/19) in patients treated for longer than 98 days but was 87% (81/93) in patients treated for shorter than 98 days. These results demonstrate that RASs prevalence and their impact in real world practice are in general agreement with registration trials, and suggest that longer treatment duration may overcome the negative impact of baseline RASs on SVR12 rates in clinical practice.\",\"The novel available interferon (IFN)-free regimens significantly improved the sustained virological response (SVR) in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), without important side effects and with shorter duration of treatment. In a subset of patients, however, the treatment failure (TF) was due to the presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) that lead to virological breakthrough (BT) or relapse. We analysed in this case series the role of RAS on the TF in cirrhotic patients with genotype (GT)4, treated with a previous IFN-free regimen, and retreated with the combination of sofosbuvir (SOF)/velpatasvir (VEL) for 12 or 24 weeks, without ribavirin (RBV).\",\"Approximately 10 million people in Pakistan are infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Most patients develop chronic hepatitis, with rare cases of spontaneous clearance. However, little is known about multidrug resistant viral variants in Pakistan.\",\"Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have transformed traditional treatment options for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. DAA combinations have been shown to be highly effective in reducing the burden of chronic HCV infection in clinical trials and have been recommended by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) treatment guidelines. This review examines the results of second-generation DAA combinations in real-life clinical practice in patients with genotypes 1-3 and in those co-infected with HIV (real-world data in genotypes 4-6 are rare). Second generation DAAs (sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir, sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir, glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir, grazoprevir plus elbasvir) have very high SVR rates and good safety profiles, higher resistance barriers and are more convenient. Real-world data in all 3 genotypes generally support the EASL guidelines and high overall sustained virological response rates are reported with recommended regimens. However, real-world data are only available for sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir. Furthermore, because of the existing level of evidence, it is difficult to define optimal regimens based on real-world data (ie, treatment duration, when to include ribavirin and options for patients with cirrhosis). The real-life challenges of managing HIV-coinfected patients are also discussed showing the additional burden of avoiding drug-drug interactions between DAAs and antiretrovirals.\",\"The presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) at NS5A region might compromise the efficacy of Direct Acting Antiviral agents (DAAs). HCV resistance at NS5A region is mainly focused on patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1a (G1a) and 3 (G3) with other factors of poor treatment response (ie cirrhosis, prior treatment-exposure, or HCV-RNA >800 000 IU/mL). Herein, we evaluated in a cohort of HCV G1a and G3 infected patients the prevalence of RASs at domain I NS5A using population-based sequencing and the impact of RASs on the optimization of current therapeutic strategies. The RASs considered as clinically relevant were: M28A/G/T, Q30D/E/H/G/K/L/R, L31M/V/F, H58D, and Y93C/H/N/S for G1a and Y93H for G3. A total of 232 patients na\\u00efve to NS5A inhibitors were included (166 G1a, 66 G3). The overall prevalence of NS5A RASs for G1a and G3 patients was low (5.5%) or null, respectively. A high proportion of patients harbored, at least, one factor of poor response (78.9% for G1a, and 75.8% for G3). Overall, the rates of patients harboring NS5A RASs in combination with any of the other factors were low and the vast majority of patients (G1a> 94% and G3 100%) could be treated with standard treatments of 12 weeks without ribavirin. In conclusion, testing NS5A RASs in specific HCV-infected populations (ie G1a & G3, cirrhosis, prior treatment experienced, HCV-RNA >800 000 IU/mL) might be useful to optimize current NS5A-based therapies avoiding ribavirin-related toxicities, and shortening treatment duration in the majority of patients.\",\"Several arenaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever (HF) disease in humans and represent important public health problems in their endemic regions. In addition, evidence indicates that the worldwide-distributed prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus is a neglected human pathogen of clinical significance. There are no licensed arenavirus vaccines, and current antiarenavirus therapy is limited to an off-label use of ribavirin that is only partially effective. Therefore, there is an unmet need for novel therapeutics to combat human pathogenic arenaviruses, a task that will be facilitated by the identification of compounds with antiarenaviral activity that could serve as probes to identify arenavirus-host interactions suitable for targeting, as well as lead compounds to develop future antiarenaviral drugs. Screening of a combinatorial library of Kr\\u00f6nhke pyridines identified compound KP-146 [(5-(5-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[ b][1,4] dioxin-6-yl)-4'-methoxy-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl)thiophene-2-carboxamide] as having strong anti-lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) activity in cultured cells. KP-146 did not inhibit LCMV cell entry but rather interfered with the activity of the LCMV ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) responsible for directing virus RNA replication and gene transcription, as well as with the budding process mediated by the LCMV matrix Z protein. LCMV variants with increased resistance to KP-146 did not emerge after serial passages in the presence of KP-146. Our findings support the consideration of Kr\\u00f6hnke pyridine scaffold as a valuable source to identify compounds that could serve as tools to dissect arenavirus-host interactions, as well as lead candidate structures to develop antiarenaviral drugs.\",\"S282T in NS5B is the primary amino acid substitution associated with resistance to sofosbuvir (SOF) but has rarely been detected in patients treated with a SOF-based regimen. Here, the emergence and fitness of the S282T substitution in virologic failure patients administered SOF-based regimens across the SOF and ledipasvir (LDV)/SOF phase 2 and 3 programs was evaluated. Plasma samples collected at baseline and at virologic failure were amplified and deep sequenced (1% cutoff). To date, over 12,000 patients have been treated in SOF or LDV/SOF phase 2 and 3 studies. Of these, deep sequencing was available at baseline in 8598 patients (62.4% genotype [GT] 1, 10.7% GT2, 20.9% GT3, and 6.0% GT4-6) and at virologic failure in 901 patients. In the 8598 patients, no S282T substitution was detected at baseline; at virologic failure, 10 of the 901 (1%) patients had S282T detected. The SOF-based regimen associated with treatment-emergent S282T was SOF monotherapy in two patients, retreatment with LDV/SOF in prior LDV/SOF failures in three patients, LDV/SOF for 8 weeks in 1 GT1 patient, LDV/SOF for 12 weeks in 1 patient each with GT3, GT4, and GT5, and LDV/SOF + ribavirin for 12 weeks in 1 GT6 patient. Nine of 10 patients with emergent S282T received an SOF-based retreatment regimen, eight of whom achieved sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment and one of whom failed retreatment. Conclusion: The emergence of S282T substitution was rare in patients who fail SOF-based regimens. Successful retreatment of prior SOF failure patients is possible in the presence of S282T substitution with SOF in combination with various direct-acting antiviral agents.

Recently, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have been shown to attenuate IR in CHC patients; however, their effect on patient quality of life remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of the current prospective study was to determine the effects of BCAA supplement on IR and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in patients with CHC. In the study, 20 non-diabetic patients with CHC, who were non-responders to peginterferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin, were recruited. Patients took a BCAA supplement once a day (30 g, after a minimum 10-h overnight fast) for 3 months. Serum levels of glucose, insulin, albumin, triglycerides and cholesterol were measured at 0 and 3 months. Additionally, IR was measured using the Homeostasis Model Assessment-IR, HR-QoL was assessed using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey and viral load was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using Taqman probes. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine statistical significance. The results indicated that 70% of the subjects were positive for IR, which decreased to 50% by the end of the study; furthermore, 85% of the subjects demonstrated some level of improvement. Overall, the BCAA treatment significantly decreased IR (P=0.006) and augmented serum albumin concentration (P=0.008) compared with basal values. Additionally, by the end of the treatment, viral load and triglycerides levels had decreased, though these results were not significant (P=0.084 and P=0.080, respectively). BCAA treatment also improved HR-QoL regarding role limitations due to physical health problems (P=0.017), role limitations due to emotional problems (P=0.026) and social function (P=0.008). In conclusion, BCAA supplementation reduced IR and improved HR-QoL in patients with CHC. These findings support the application of IR therapy as a possible therapeutic strategy for hepatitis C infection.\",\"To evaluate the efficacy of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in Kanto Rosai Hospital.\",\"Advanced age has been a major limitation of interferon-based treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection because of its poor response and tolerability. Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drug regimens are safe and highly effective, allowing administration of treatment also in elderly.

Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12), adverse effects (AEs), comorbidities, discontinuation, and death rates were recorded. Efficacy and safety of therapy were assessed in patients aged \\u226570 years and compared with data from patients <70 years.There were 117 patients aged \\u226570 years, preponderantly females (58.9%), mean age 73.3 \\u00b1 2.8 years (range 70-82), and 37 (31.6%) were treatment-experienced. Comorbidities were reported in 60.6% of patients \\u226570 years and in 39.8% of those <70 years (P < .001). SVR12 rates based on intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were 97.4% and 100%, respectively, in patients \\u226570 years, compared to 97.8% and 99.6%, respectively, in patients <70 years (P = ns and P = ns).

We performed this meta-analysis to directly compare grazoprevir plus elbasvir and ribavirin regimen vs. grazoprevir and elbasvir without ribavirin in the treatment of hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection and to precisely evaluate the efficacy of the latter regimen in cirrhotic, IL28 CC genotype patients and those coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus.\",\"Host lipid metabolism influences viral replication and lifecycle of hepatitis C virus. Our aim was to evaluate changes in glucose and lipid metabolism of patients with chronic hepatitis C after therapy with direct acting antivirals (DAA).\",\"The recent development of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection could lead to higher sustained virological response (SVR) rates, with shorter treatment durations and fewer adverse events compared with regimens that include interferon. However, a relatively small proportion of patients cannot achieve SVR in the first treatment, including DAAs with or without peginterferon and/or ribavirin. Although retreatment with a combination of DAAs should be conducted for these patients, it is more difficult to achieve SVR when retreating these patients because of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) or treatment-emergent substitutions. In Japan, HCV genotype 1b (GT1b) is founded in 70% of HCV-infected individuals. In this minireview, we summarize the retreatment regimens and their SVR rates for HCV GT1b. It is important to avoid drugs that target the regions targeted by initial drugs, but next-generation combinations of DAAs, such as sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir for 12 wk or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 12 wk, are proposed to be potential solution for the HCV GT1b-infected patients with treatment failure, mainly on a basis of targeting distinctive regions. Clinicians should follow the new information and resources for DAAs and select the proper combination of DAAs for the retreatment of HCV GT1b-infected patients with treatment failure.\",\"The hepatitis C virus (HCV), the most predominant cause of liver failure worldwide, is associated with the development of diabetes mellitus (DM) and insulin resistance (IR), both in vivo and in vitro. DM and IR aggravate the rate of fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Most studies have revealed that patients with HCV are at a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), compared with controls or patients with hepatitis B. In the same way, patients with T2D are highly prone to severe HCV clinical outcomes and increased progression to fibrosis and cirrhosis, ultimately leading to HCC. HCV interferes with the insulin-signaling pathway by modulating cellular gene expression such as up-regulation of inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\\u03b1, hypophosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2, phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), up-regulation of gluconeogenic genes, accumulation of lipids, and targeting of lipid storage organelles. Owing to the pathological association between HCV and DM, the possibility of HCV eradication, resulting in reduced morbidity and mortality rate due to T2D, cannot be ruled out. HCV diabetes-associated IR can be targeted for HCV therapy. However, few such studies have revealed that IR minimizes (interferes with) the response rate of interferon/ribavirin treatment.\",\"The 4 genotypes of hepatitis E virus (HEV) that infect humans (genotypes 1-4) vary in geographical distribution, transmission, and pathogenesis. Little is known about the properties of HEV or its hosts that contribute to these variations. Primary isolates grow poorly in cell culture; most studies have relied on variants adapted to cancer cell lines, which likely alter virus biology. We investigated the infection and replication of primary isolates of HEV in hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) derived from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells.\",\"The high rate of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) was one of the key issues of global public health concern. Interferon (IFN)-\\u03bb relevant genes were in the antiviral treatment pathway, not only influenced hepatitis C virus (HCV) spontaneous clearance, but also affected the IFN-mediated viral clearance. The aim of this study was to identify the association of interleukin 28B (IL28B), myxovirus resistance A (MxA) gene polymorphisms with HCV spontaneous clearance and therapeutic response in Chinese CHC patients. IL28B and MxA gene genotypes were detected among 231 CHC carriers, 428 subjects with HCV spontaneous clearance and 662 CHC patients with pegylated IFN-\\u03b1 and ribavirin (pegIFN-\\u03b1/RBV) treatment. Patients with MxA rs2071430 TT genotype were more likely to develop HCV infection chronicity (additive model: odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.48, P = 0.042). IL28B rs1298075 variant genotypes (additive model: OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.34-0.98, P = 0.040) and MxA rs17000900 variant genotypes (additive model: OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30-0.99, P = 0.048) were less likely to achieve a sustained virological response. The life table indicated that patients with IL28B rs1298075 AG genotype were slower to achieve a viral load 106 copies/ml (all P < 0.05). This study illustrated that the carriage of IL28B rs12980275 AA had a positive effect on treatment response to pegIFN-\\u03b1/RBV among Chinese CHC patients.\",\"Since the identification of the novel reassortant avian influenza A (H7N9) virus in China in 2013, until Jun 30, 2017, the virus has caused five epidemic waves leading to a total of 1,552 human infections, with a fatality rate of about 40%. In the spring of 2017, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N9 virus emerged and has caused 25 human infections. The HPAI H7N9 virus has some biological differences from the LPAI one, such as its multiple basic amino acid residues on HA leading to its independence on trypsin for replication. The pathogenicity of the HPAI H7N9 virus to experimental animals or humans is still unclear. A(H7N9) vaccine development for pandemic preparedness is ongoing, including the reassortment (H7N9/PR8) reverse genetic based vaccine, the virus like particle (VLP) vaccine, the intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), the non-adjuvant Vero cell culture-derived inactivated whole-virus vaccine, the MDCK culture-derived vaccine, the H7 DNA vaccine and the recombinant replicative H7N9 virus (H7N9-53TM) vaccine. Five neuramidinase resistant sites of A(H7N9) virus isolated from patients have been reported. Some alternative drugs have been studied, such as DAS181 (Fludase), ribavirin, troglitazone and minocycline. Persistent surveillance and enhanced global control are essential to fight against human infections with A(H7N9) virus.\",\"Targeting host functions essential for viral replication has been considered as a broad spectrum and resistance-refractory antiviral approach. However, only a few host functions have, thus far, been validated as broad-spectrum antiviral targets in vivo. ER \\u03b1-glucosidases I and II have been demonstrated to be essential for the morphogenesis of many enveloped viruses, including members from four families of viruses causing hemorrhagic fever. In vivo antiviral efficacy of various iminosugar-based ER \\u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors has been reported in animals infected with Dengue, Japanese encephalitis, Ebola, Marburg and influenza viruses. Herein, we established Huh7.5-derived cell lines with ER \\u03b1-glucosidase I or II knockout using CRISPR/Cas9 and demonstrated that the replication of Dengue, Yellow fever and Zika viruses was reduced by only 1-2 logs in the knockout cell lines. The results clearly indicate that only a partial suppression of viral replication can possibly be achieved with a complete inhibition of ER-\\u03b1-glucosidases I or II by their inhibitors. We therefore explore to improve the antiviral efficacy of a lead iminosugar IHVR-19029 through combination with another broad-spectrum antiviral agent, favipiravir (T-705). Indeed, combination of IHVR-19029 and T-705 synergistically inhibited the replication of Yellow fever and Ebola viruses in cultured cells. Moreover, in a mouse model of Ebola virus infection, combination of sub-optimal doses of IHVR-19029 and T-705 significantly increased the survival rate of infected animals. We have thus proved the concept of combinational therapeutic strategy for the treatment of viral hemorrhagic fevers with broad spectrum host- and viral- targeting antiviral agents.\",\"Despite the excellent efficacy of direct acting antivirals (DAA) for hepatitis C virus (HCV), treatment failures do occur. Until recently, retreatment decisions after DAA failure were influenced by the number of available agents, concerns about HCV drug resistance, and lack of data regarding retreatment. Recommended treatment approaches previously depended on limited clinical trials and expert opinion. In this article, we review the current state of the evidence for HCV retreatment after DAA failure. Based on recent clinical trial data, most patients who fail HCV treatment with DAA agents now have excellent retreatment options. While some patients may benefit from resistance testing after DAA therapy failure to select the optimal treatment and duration, newly approved salvage therapies are not significantly impacted by common mutations and have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for HCV retreatment without regard for the presence of resistance associated substitutions. While prior retreatment efforts were limited to longer courses of therapy, the addition of ribavirin, or novel combinations of approved therapies based on expert guidance, current DAA options make HCV retreatment in the DAA era more streamlined and evidence-based.\",\"Ultraviolet light in the UVC range is a commonly used disinfectant to control viruses in clinical settings and water treatment. However, it is currently unknown whether human viral pathogens may develop resistance to such stressor. Here, we investigate the adaptation of an enteric pathogen, human echovirus 11, to disinfection by UVC, and characterized the underlying phenotypic and genotypic changes. Repeated exposure to UVC lead to a reduction in the UVC inactivation rate of approximately 15 per cent compared to that of the wild-type and the control populations. Time-series next-generation sequencing data revealed that this adaptation to UVC was accompanied by a decrease in the virus mutation rate. The inactivation efficiency of UVC was additionally compromised by a shift from first-order to biphasic inactivation kinetics, a form of 'viral persistence' present in the UVC resistant and control populations. Importantly, populations with biphasic inactivation kinetics also exhibited resistance to ribavirin, an antiviral drug that, as UVC, interferes with the viral replication. Overall, the ability of echovirus 11 to adapt to UVC is limited, but it may have relevant consequences for disinfection in clinical settings and water treatment plants.\",\"Several highly effective, interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based regimens are available for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Despite impressive efficacy overall, a small proportion of patients in registrational trials experienced treatment failure, which in some cases was associated with the detection of HCV resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) at baseline. In this article, we describe methods and key findings from independent regulatory analyses investigating the impact of baseline nonstructural (NS) 3 Q80K and NS5A RASs on the efficacy of current United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved regimens for patients with HCV genotype (GT) 1 or GT3 infection. These analyses focused on clinical trials that included patients who were previously na\\u00efve to the DAA class(es) in their investigational regimen and characterized the impact of baseline RASs that were enriched in the viral population as natural or transmitted polymorphisms (i.e., not drug-selected RASs). We used a consistent approach to optimize comparability of results across different DAA regimens and patient populations, including the use of a 15% sensitivity cutoff for next-generation sequencing results and standardized lists of NS5A RASs. These analyses confirmed that detection of NS3 Q80K or NS5A baseline RASs was associated with reduced treatment efficacy for multiple DAA regimens, but their impact was often minimized with the use of an intensified treatment regimen, such as a longer treatment duration and/or addition of ribavirin. We discuss the drug resistance-related considerations that contributed to pretreatment resistance testing and treatment recommendations in drug labeling for FDA-approved DAA regimens.\",\"Glecaprevir (formerly ABT-493, pangenotypic NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and pibrentasvir (formerly ABT-530, pangenotypic NS5A inhibitor) are second generation direct acting antivirals (DAA) for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C (HCV). It is a fixed dose ribavirin (RBV)-free regimen with activity against genotypes (GT) 1-6. In vitro the two antivirals have synergistic activity with a high barrier to resistance and potent activity against common polymorphisms. It is once daily oral dosing with minimal absorption, primary biliary excretion, and negligible renal excretion, making it safe for patients with renal impairment. This regimen is being reviewed because it is the first pangenotypic regimen suitable for those with renal impairment and prior DAA failure. Areas covered: The key phase 2 and 3 trials which investigated the efficacy and safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir are reviewed by methodology, primary end point, baseline demographic data, response rates, and adverse events. Literature search methodology involved reviewing key abstracts presented at the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease and European Association for the Study of Liver. Expert commentary: The advantages and limitations of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir will be reviewed in comparison to its competitor drug on the market.\",\"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) has affected an estimate of 80 million individuals worldwide and is a strain of public health. Around 25-30% of patients in Europe and the US infected with HIV are coinfected with HCV. Despite treatment modalities containing a NS3/4A protease inhibitor in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin prior to 2013 improved SVR rates, the amount of severe side effects was high. Nowadays, oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) combination therapy offers excellent treatment efficacy, safety and tolerability. This review focuses on current literature and clinical evidence and their impact regarding NS3/4A protease inhibitors. In addition, pitfalls in treatment from HIV- and HBV-coinfected patients will also be discussed. In the era of DAA treatment, the third-generation pan-genotypic NS3/4A protease inhibitors (mainly grazoprevir, glecaprevir and voxilaprevir) show a high antiviral activity and genetic resistance barrier with cure rates of over 95% when combined with an NS5A inhibitor, irrespectively of baseline resistance associated variants (RASs) being present. These new key components of DAA combination therapy are impressive options to eradicate HCV in the so called difficult-to-treat population (e.g. compensated cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease and patients who failed previous DAA treatment).\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the leading causes of liver diseases and transplantation worldwide. The current available therapy for HCV infection is based on interferon-\\u03b1, ribavirin and the new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), such as NS3 protease and NS5B polymerase inhibitors. However, the high costs of drug design, severe side effects and HCV resistance presented by the existing treatments demonstrate the need for developing more efficient anti-HCV agents. This study aimed to evaluate the antiviral effects of sorbifolin (1) and pedalitin (2), two flavonoids from Pterogyne nitens on the HCV replication cycle. These compounds were investigated for their anti-HCV activities using genotype 2a JFH-1 subgenomic replicons and infectious virus systems. Flavonoids 1 and 2 inhibited virus entry up to 45.0% and 78.7% respectively at non-cytotoxic concentrations. The mechanism of the flavonoid 2 block to virus entry was demonstrated to be by both the direct action on virus particles and the interference on the host cells. Alternatively, the flavonoid 1 activity was restricted to its virucidal effect. Additionally, no inhibitory effects on HCV replication and release were observed by treating cells with these flavonoids. These data are the first description of 1 and 2 possessing in vitro anti-HCV activity.\",\"Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a representative member of the New World alphaviruses. It is transmitted by mosquito vectors and causes highly debilitating disease in humans, equids, and other vertebrate hosts. Despite a continuous public health threat, very few compounds with anti-VEEV activity in cell culture and in mouse models have been identified to date, and rapid development of virus resistance to some of them has been recorded. In this study, we investigated the possibility of using a modified nucleoside analog, \\u03b2-d-N [4]-hydroxycytidine (NHC), as an anti-VEEV agent and defined the mechanism of its anti-VEEV activity. The results demonstrate that NHC is a very potent antiviral agent. It affects both the release of genome RNA-containing VEE virions and their infectivity. Both of these antiviral activities are determined by the NHC-induced accumulation of mutations in virus-specific RNAs. The antiviral effect is most prominent when NHC is applied early in the infectious process, during the amplification of negative- and positive-strand RNAs in infected cells. Most importantly, only a low-level resistance of VEEV to NHC can be developed, and it requires acquisition and cooperative function of more than one mutation in nsP4. These adaptive mutations are closely located in the same segment of nsP4. Our data suggest that NHC is more potent than ribavirin as an anti-VEEV agent and likely can be used to treat other alphavirus infections.IMPORTANCE Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) can cause widespread epidemics among humans and domestic animals. VEEV infections result in severe meningoencephalitis and long-term sequelae. No approved therapeutics exist for treatment of VEEV infections. Our study demonstrates that \\u03b2-d-N [4]-hydroxycytidine (NHC) is a very potent anti-VEEV compound, with the 50% effective concentration being below 1 \\u03bcM. The mechanism of NHC antiviral activity is based on induction of high mutation rates in the viral genome. Accordingly, NHC treatment affects both the rates of particle release and the particle infectivity. Most importantly, in contrast to most of the anti-alphavirus drugs that are under development, resistance of VEEV to NHC develops very inefficiently. Even low levels of resistance require acquisition of multiple mutations in the gene of the VEEV-specific RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsP4.\",\"Mutations in HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) play a vital role in virus resistance. The aim of this study was to develop a correlation between NS5A mutations (genotype 3a) and virological response towards interferon alpha (IFN-\\u03b1) plus ribavirin therapy.\",\"In the era of direct-acting antivirals, hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 3 remains as the most difficult-to-treat HCV-GT. Currently, data on the efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (SOF/LDV+RBV) in GT3-infected patients are limited. We investigated the efficacy of this regimen in a real-life cohort from Austria.\",\"The coronavirus (CoV) RNA genome is the largest among the single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. CoVs encode a proofreading 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold-decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with wild-type MHV (WT-MHV). Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication and increased competitive fitness without reversion at the ExoN(-) active site. Furthermore, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was less susceptible than MHV-ExoN(-) P3 to multiple nucleoside analogues, suggesting that MHV-ExoN(-) was under selection for increased replication fidelity. We subsequently identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially accounted for the reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. Our results suggest that increased replication fidelity is selected in ExoN(-) CoVs and that there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and indicate that multiple replicase proteins could compensate for ExoN functions during replication.IMPORTANCE Uniquely among RNA viruses, CoVs encode a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nsp14 that mediates high-fidelity RNA genome replication. Proofreading-deficient CoVs with disrupted ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] either are nonviable or have significant defects in replication, RNA synthesis, fidelity, fitness, and virulence. In this study, we showed that ExoN(-) murine hepatitis virus can adapt during long-term passage for increased replication and fitness without reverting the ExoN-inactivating mutations. Passage-adapted ExoN(-) mutants also demonstrate increasing resistance to nucleoside analogues that is explained only partially by secondary mutations in nsp12 and nsp14. These data suggest that enhanced resistance to nucleoside analogues is mediated by the interplay of multiple replicase proteins and support the proposed link between CoV fidelity and fitness.\",\"Activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is a cellular survival mechanism in response to chemotherapy in cancers. In this work, we demonstrate that targeting eIF4E by ribavirin sensitizes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell response to doxorubicin. Ribavirin inhibits growth and survival of HCC cells, and to a greater extent than in normal liver cells. Its combination with doxorubicin achieves greater efficacy than single drug in vitro and in vivo. Ribavirin suppresses phosphorylation of molecules involved in Akt/mTOR/eIF4E pathway. Overexpression of the phosphomimetic form (S209D) but not the nonphosphorylatable form (S209A) eIF4E significantly reverses the inhibitory effects of ribavirin. Interestingly, doxorubicin significantly increases p-eIF4E(S209) level in a dose- and time-dependent manner, suggesting that doxorubicin induces eIF4E activation in HCC cells. In addition, eIF4E activation induced by doxorubicin in HCC cells is inhibited by ribavirin. Our work demonstrates the greater efficacy of ribavirin and doxorubicin combination and its underlying mechanisms.\",\"Although overexpression of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is detected in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and associated with poor prognosis, the possible roles of eIF4E in RCC have not been revealed.\",\"Failure to achieve sustained virological response (SVR) with hepatitis C virus (HCV) direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based regimens is commonly associated with emergence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs). Retreatment of patients who failed prior DAAs remains challenging. The aim of this prospective and randomized study was to evaluate the efficacy (primary endpoint: SVR 12 weeks after end of treatment [SVR12]) and safety of sofosbuvir + grazoprevir/elbasvir + ribavirin for 16 or 24 weeks in patients who had failed to achieve SVR on previous NS5A- or NS3-based therapy and with evidence of RASs at failure.\",\"Almost 30 years ago, about 30% of Japanese hemophiliacs became infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) after receiving contaminated blood products. While several studies have reported the high efficacy and safety of direct acting antivirals (DAA) in HIV-1 co-infected patients, such data are limited in hemophiliacs.\",\"The availability of novel direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) represents a new era of curative hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, with over 95% of patients infected with HCV genotype 1 achieving sustained virological response (SVR). Nevertheless, the majority of patients globally are unable to access these treatments because of cost and infrastructure constraints and, thus, remain untreated and uncured.\",\"To evaluate the cost-utility of treatment with elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) regimens compared with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir \\u00b1 ribavirin (3D \\u00b1 RBV), and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype (GT) 1 infection.\",\"Pretreatment evaluation of HCV-infected patients is a complex interplay between multiple clinical and viral parameters, leading to a tailored approach that may bring real-life sustained virological response (SVR) rates close to 98%-99%.\",\"Growing resistance in malarial parasites, particularly in Plasmodium falciparum needs a serious search for the discovery of novel drug targets. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is an important target for antimalarial drug discovery process in P. falciparum for the treatment of malaria. In the absence of x-ray crystal structure of this enzyme, homology modeling proved to be a reasonable alternate to study substrate binding mechanisms of this enzyme. In this study, a 3-D homology model for P. falciparum IMPDH was constructed taking human IMPDH (PDB code 1NF7) as template. Furthermore, an in-silico combinatorial library of ribavirin (RVP) derivatives (1347 molecules) was designed and virtually screened for ligands having selectively greater binding affinity with Plasmodium falciparum IMPDH relative to human IMPDH II. A total of five Ribavirin derivatives were identified as having greater binding affinity (-126 to -108Kcal/mol and -9.4 to -8.6Kcal/mol) with Plasmodium falciparum IMPDH. These five inhibitors should be used as selective and potent for Plasmodium falciparum IMPDH. Such type of study will provide information to synthetic medicinal chemist to enhance the potential of compounds (RVP derivatives) as chemotherapeutic agents to fight against the increasing burden of malarial infections.\",\"The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, dosage, administration, and role of elbasvir-grazoprevir in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are reviewed.\",\"Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) can jeopardize the effectiveness of DAAs in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The selection pressure by pegylated-interferon (Peg-IFN) plus ribavirin (P/R) treatment may enhance HCV genome variation. However, whether P/R treatment alters the rate of change of RASs is still unclear.\",\"Daclatasvir, asunaprevir (ASV), and beclabuvir (BCV) are direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and safety of this three-drug combination in HCV genotype 1 infection. Eleven electronic search engines were searched for relevant publications. Studies were screened for eligibility and data was extracted. The outcomes were pooled as event rate and risk ratio (RR). The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017054391). Among the included six studies, five studies were included for the meta-analysis (n = 1261). The three-drug combination showed a high response rate in na\\u00efve patients with sustained virologic response at week-12 posttreatment (SVR12) rate = 95.7% (95%CI [93.8-97.1]) and no difference detected by adding ribavirin (RBV) (the pooled RR = 0.98, 95%CI [0.90-1.08], P = 0.70) or comparing with interferon-experienced patients (RR = 1.02, 95%CI [0.98-1.07], P = 0.31) regardless the genotype 1 subtypes or IL28B genotype. Treatment failure was minimal and showed no difference regarding the previous comparisons. Increasing the dose or the duration did not show a significant increase in the efficacy. In conclusion, this analysis showed high response rates in HCV genotype 1-infected patients treated with daclatasvir, ASV, and BCV irrespective of RBV use, prior interferon-based therapy, or restriction on non-cirrhotic patients, IL28B genotype, or baseline resistance-associated variants.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects 130-170 million people worldwide. Recently, direct-acting antivirals have been shown to eradicate HCV infection in 90-95 % of non-cirrhotic patients depending on genotype, treatment experience, and regimen used. Similar rates are achieved among compensated cirrhotics, although longer treatment duration and/or ribavirin may be required. HCV uses host lipid metabolism for its lifecycle and can cause hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Hepatic steatosis, defined as excessive triglyceride deposition in hepatocytes, affects approximately half of HCV-infected individuals. Genetic factors and co-morbidities can drive further steatosis, which in turn can instigate fibrosis and progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Polymorphisms in genes that modulate lipid deposition in hepatocytes such as patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) and transmembrane six superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2) predispose people to steatosis. Metabolic syndrome, obesity, and insulin resistance are increasing worldwide and further contribute to hepatic steatosis, and alcohol has long been recognized as a cause of lipid deposition in the liver. HIV and antiretroviral drugs, but not HBV, may further drive hepatic steatosis. While many of these factors limit response to interferon-based regimens for treating HCV, responses to direct-acting antivirals appear not to be impaired. The effect of HCV eradication on hepatic steatosis and progression to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma warrants further study in the era of direct-acting antivirals.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces steatosis and is accompanied by multiple metabolic alterations including hyperuricemia, reversible hypocholesterolemia and insulin resistance. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglyceride levels are increased by peginterferon and ribavirin combination therapy when a sustained virologic response (SVR) is achieved in patients with HCV. Steatosis is significantly more common in patients with HCV genotype 3 but interferon-free regimens are not always effective for treating HCV genotype 3 infections. HCV infection increases fatty acid synthase levels, resulting in the accumulation of fatty acids in hepatocytes. Of note, low-density lipoprotein receptor, scavenger receptor class B type I and Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 proteins are candidate receptors that may be involved in HCV. They are also required for the uptake of cholesterol from the external environment of hepatocytes. Among HCV-infected patients with or without human immunodeficiency virus infection, changes in serum lipid profiles are observed during interferon-free treatment and after the achievement of an SVR. It is evident that HCV affects cholesterol metabolism during interferon-free regimens. Although higher SVR rates were achieved with interferon-free treatment of HCV, special attention must also be paid to unexpected adverse events based on host metabolic changes including hyperlipidemia.\",\"The safety and efficacy of an IFN-free regimen using asunaprevir (ASV) and daclatasvir (DCV) for recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection after liver transplantation (LT) have not been evaluated in Japan. A multicenter study of LT recipients (n = 74) with recurrent HCV genotype 1b infection treated with ASV-DCV for 24 weeks was performed. Medical history was positive for pegylated interferon and ribavirin (Peg-IFN/RBV) in 40 (54.1%) patients, and for simeprevir (SMV) with Peg-IFN/RBV in 12 (16.2%) patients. Resistance-associated variants (RAVs) were positive at D168 (n = 1) in the NS3, and at L31 (n = 4), Y93 (n = 4), and L31/Y93 (n = 1) in the NS5A region of the HCV genome. Sixty-one (82.4%) patients completed the 24-week treatment protocol. Although sustained viral response (SVR) was achieved in 49 (80.3%) patients, it was achieved in only two (16.7%) patients among those with histories of receiving SMV (n = 12). Univariate analysis showed that a history of SMV (P < .01) and the presence of mutations in NS5A (P = .02) were the significant factors for no-SVR. By excluding the patients with either a history of SMV-based treatment or RAVs in NS3/NS5A, the SVR rate was 96.4%. By excluding the patients with a history of SMV and those with RAVs in NS3/NS5A, viral clearance of ASV-DCV was favorable, with a high SVR rate.\",\"Few real-life data are available on the retreatment of patients who failed direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-regimens. We reported the outcome of retreatment with approved DAA regimens in a real-life cohort of patients who previously failed an all-oral DAAs combination and we analyzed the association with resistance substitutions (RASs) performed at the time of virological failure.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a major comorbidity in patients with hemophilia.\",\"A 40-year-old male patient with virologic relapse after daclatasvir plus asunaprevir therapy for a serogroup 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection visited our hospital for retreatment. Virologic examinations revealed that a genotype 2b HCV strain carrying both NS3-S122N / D168A and NA5A-R30Q / L31M / Q54H / Y93H mutations had relapsed. The patient received sofosbuvir plus ribavirin therapy, but virologic relapse occurred once again. Sequencing of the HCV genome clarified an intergenotypic recombination of 2b and 1b with an estimated crossover point between nucleotides 3114 and 3115, corresponding to the N-terminal end of the NS3 region (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases accession no. LC273304). The NS5B-S282T mutation was not detected in the HCV strain, and resistance-association substitutions in the NS3 and NS5A regions were similar to those at baseline. Direct sequencing of the core and NS4A regions corresponding to the targeting sites of genotyping and serogrouping, respectively, is useful to determine the combination of direct-acting antivirals when a discrepancy is observed between the serogroup and genotype of HCV strains.\",\"One of the multiple factors contributing to virological response in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10). Its level reflects the status of interferon-stimulated genes, which in turn is associated with virological response to antiviral therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of serum IP-10 levels on sustained virological response (SVR) and the association of this parameter with insulin resistance (IR) and liver histology.\",\"Influenza virus inflicts a heavy death toll annually and resistance to existing antiviral drugs has generated interest in the development of agents with novel mechanisms of action. Favipiravir is an antiviral drug that acts by increasing the genome-wide mutation rate of influenza A virus (IAV). Potential synergistic benefits of combining oseltamivir and favipiravir have been demonstrated in animal models of influenza, but the population-level effects of combining the drugs are unknown. In order to elucidate the underlying evolutionary processes at play, we performed genome-wide sequencing of IAV experimental populations subjected to serial passaging in vitro under a combined protocol of oseltamivir and favipiravir. We describe the interplay between mutation, selection, and genetic drift that ultimately culminates in population extinction. In particular, selective sweeps around oseltamivir resistance mutations reduce genome-wide variation while deleterious mutations hitchhike to fixation given the increased mutational load generated by favipiravir. This latter effect reduces viral fitness and accelerates extinction compared with IAV populations treated with favipiravir alone, but risks spreading both established and newly emerging mutations, including possible drug resistance mutations, if transmission occurs before the viral populations are eradicated.\",\"Treatment of HCV genotype (GT) 2-infected Japanese patients with paritaprevir (NS3/4A inhibitor boosted with ritonavir) and ombitasvir (NS5A inhibitor) without ribavirin for 12 weeks in the phase 2 study M12-536, and with ribavirin for 16 weeks in phase 3 study GIFT II resulted in SVR rates of 72.2% to 91.5%. Overall, 11 out of 125 patients with GT2a and 37 out of 79 patients with GT2b infection experienced virologic failure. The prevalence of baseline polymorphisms in NS3 and NS5A and their the impact on treatment outcome, as well as the development of viral resistance in GT2-infected patients experiencing virologic failure were evaluated by HCV NS3 and NS5A population and clonal sequence analyses. Baseline polymorphisms in NS3 that confer resistance to paritaprevir were rare in both GT2a- and GT2b-infected patients, while baseline polymorphisms in NS5A that confer resistance to ombitasvir were detected in 11.2% and 14.1% of the GT2a- and GT2b-infected patients, respectively. There was no significant impact of baseline polymorphisms on treatment outcome in Japanese patients. The most common treatment-emergent substitutions at the time of virologic failure occurred at amino acid positions 168 in NS3 and 28 in NS5A in both GT2a- and GT2b-infected patients. Although there was a higher rate of virologic failure in patients with GT2b infection, the resistance analyses presented in this report support the conclusion that testing for baseline resistance-associated polymorphisms is not warranted for HCV GT2-infected patients treated with a regimen of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + ribavirin for 16 weeks.\",\"The efficacy and safety of an investigational combination of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r) plus sofosbuvir (SOF) \\u00b1 ribavirin (RBV) in patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection with or without cirrhosis was evaluated. Patients with HCV genotype 3 infection without cirrhosis were randomized to receive OBV/PTV/r + SOF \\u00b1 RBV for 12 weeks; OBV/PTV/r + SOF + RBV was administered to genotype 3-infected patients with cirrhosis for 12 weeks and to genotype 2-infected patients without cirrhosis for either 6 or 8 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by sustained virologic response [HCV RNA <25 IU/mL] 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12). Safety was assessed in all treated patients. In patients with genotype 3 infection with or without cirrhosis treated with 12 weeks of OBV/PTV/r + SOF \\u00b1 RBV, the overall SVR12 rate was 98% (50/51), with no virologic failures. Patients with genotype 2 infection treated with OBV/PTV/r + SOF + RBV had SVR12 rates of 90% (9/10) and 44% (4/9) following 8- and 6-week treatment durations, respectively; failure to achieve SVR12 for these patients was due to relapse without baseline or treatment-emergent resistance-associated substitutions. Thus, the investigational combination of OBV/PTV/r with SOF \\u00b1 RBV was well tolerated and achieved high SVR rates with no virologic failures in patients with genotype 3 infection. Combining direct-acting antivirals with complementary mechanisms of action and different viral targets may be an effective treatment strategy that may allow for shorter durations of therapy.\",\"The study aimed to evaluate the effects of baseline hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) on sustained virologic response to ledipasvir (LDV)-containing regimens in the absence of sofosbuvir (SOF) in patients with HCV genotype (GT) 1 infection across 6 phase 2 clinical studies. We analysed data from 1103 patients who received either LDV + vedroprevir (NS3 protease inhibitor) + tegobuvir (NS5B inhibitor) \\u00b1 ribavirin or LDV + ribavirin + pegylated interferon. Population sequencing of HCV NS5A was performed at baseline and at virologic failure from patient plasma samples. Of 1045 patients with available baseline sequences, 747 (67.7%) had GT1a, and 298 (26.9%) had GT1b infection. The overall prevalence of NS5A RASs at baseline was 9.4%; 7.6% (57/747) and 13.8% (41/298) of patients with GT1a and GT1b infection, respectively. The majority of GT1a-infected patients with NS5A RASs at baseline had a single NS5A RAS (78.9%) at NS5A positions K24R, M28T, Q30H/L, L31M and Y93H/N/C/S. The spectrum of NS5A RASs detected in GT1b patients was much less diverse compared to GT1a patients, with all patients harbouring a single NS5A RAS either L31M or Y93H/C. For patients treated with LDV-containing regimens in the absence of SOF, the presence of baseline NS5A RASs was associated with low SVR rates. In patients with virologic failure, nearly all had either pre-existing and/or emergent NS5A RASs: 287/287 (100%) and 40/42 (95.2%) patients with GT1a and GT1b infection, respectively. Three novel NS5A substitutions were identified as emergent NS5A RASs: K26E and S38F in GT1a; and L31I in GT1b. In conclusion, the presence of NS5A RASs at baseline reduced the SVR rate in patients treated with LDV in combination vedroprevir + tegobuvir \\u00b1 ribavirin or ribavirin + pegylated interferon. Virologic failure was associated with the detection of NS5A RASs in nearly all patients. These results suggest that the resistance barrier may differ depending on HCV drug combination and may be more important than that of the individual DAAs.\",\"In Japan, daclatasvir (DCV) and asunaprevir (ASV) therapy was the first IFN-free treatment to be approved, and thousands of patients have since been successfully treated, with an SVR rate of around 90%. The converse, however, is that around 10% of patients fail to achieve viral eradication and must be retreated using a different approach. This study is to evaluate treatment efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and ribavirin in patients who failed to respond to DCV and ASV therapy.\",\"Lethal mutagenesis is a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy that employs mutagenic nucleoside analogs to exploit the high mutation rate and low mutational tolerance of many RNA viruses. Studies of mutagen-resistant viruses have identified determinants of replicative fidelity and the importance of mutation rate to viral population dynamics. We have previously demonstrated the effective lethal mutagenesis of influenza A virus using three nucleoside analogs as well as the virus's high genetic barrier to mutagen resistance. Here, we investigate the mutagen-resistant phenotypes of mutations that were enriched in drug-treated populations. We find that PB1 T123A has higher replicative fitness than the wild type, PR8, and maintains its level of genome production during 5-fluorouracil (2,4-dihydroxy-5-fluoropyrimidine) treatment. Surprisingly, this mutagen-resistant variant also has an increased baseline rate of C-to-U and G-to-A mutations. A second drug-selected mutation, PA T97I, interacts epistatically with PB1 T123A to mediate high-level mutagen resistance, predominantly by limiting the inhibitory effect of nucleosides on polymerase activity. Consistent with the importance of epistatic interactions in the influenza virus polymerase, our data suggest that nucleoside analog resistance and replication fidelity are strain dependent. Two previously identified ribavirin {1-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-2-yl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide} resistance mutations, PB1 V43I and PB1 D27N, do not confer drug resistance in the PR8 background, and the PR8-PB1 V43I polymerase exhibits a normal baseline mutation rate. Our results highlight the genetic complexity of the influenza A virus polymerase and demonstrate that increased replicative capacity is a mechanism by which an RNA virus can counter the negative effects of elevated mutation rates. IMPORTANCE RNA viruses exist as genetically diverse populations. This standing genetic diversity gives them the potential to adapt rapidly, evolve resistance to antiviral therapeutics, and evade immune responses. Viral mutants with altered mutation rates or mutational tolerance have provided insights into how genetic diversity arises and how it affects the behavior of RNA viruses. To this end, we identified variants within the polymerase complex of influenza virus that are able to tolerate drug-mediated increases in viral mutation rates. We find that drug resistance is highly dependent on interactions among mutations in the polymerase complex. In contrast to other viruses, influenza virus counters the effect of higher mutation rates primarily by maintaining high levels of genome replication. These findings suggest the importance of maintaining large population sizes for viruses with high mutation rates and show that multiple proteins can affect both mutation rate and genome synthesis.\",\"Genetic variability in NS5A is associated with different levels of resistance to the currently licensed NS5A inhibitors. The aim of this study was to detect NS5A inhibitor resistance associated substitutions (RASs) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 (GT1) patients who are naive to direct-acting HCV antivirals.\",\"Norovirus is a major cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide and has emerged as an important issue of chronic infection in transplantation patients. Since no approved antiviral is available, we evaluated the effects of different immunosuppressants and ribavirin on norovirus and explored their mechanisms of action by using a human norovirus (HuNV) replicon-harboring model and a surrogate murine norovirus (MNV) infectious model. The roles of the corresponding drug targets were investigated by gain- or loss-of-function approaches. We found that the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506) moderately inhibited HuNV replication. Gene silencing of their cellular targets, cyclophilin A, FKBP12, and calcineurin, significantly inhibited HuNV replication. A low concentration, therapeutically speaking, of mycophenolic acid (MPA), an uncompetitive IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor, potently and rapidly inhibited norovirus replication and ultimately cleared HuNV replicons without inducible resistance following long-term drug exposure. Knockdown of the MPA cellular targets IMPDH1 and IMPDH2 suppressed HuNV replication. Consistent with the nucleotide-synthesizing function of IMPDH, exogenous guanosine counteracted the antinorovirus effects of MPA. Furthermore, the competitive IMPDH inhibitor ribavirin efficiently inhibited norovirus and resulted in an additive effect when combined with immunosuppressants. The results from this study demonstrate that calcineurin phosphatase activity and IMPDH guanine synthase activity are crucial in sustaining norovirus infection; thus, they can be therapeutically targeted. Our results suggest that MPA shall be preferentially considered immunosuppressive medication for transplantation patients at risk of norovirus infection, whereas ribavirin represents as a potential antiviral for both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients with norovirus gastroenteritis.\",\"There are millions of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus-infected patients who have been treated with a combination therapy (interferon and ribavirin) and have achieved a virological response (SVR) worldwide. The aim of this study is to evaluate the risk factors for de-novo diabetes mellitus in CHC patients treated with combination therapy (interferon and ribavirin) and have achieved an SVR.\",\"To determine the number of mutations in the NS5A region of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and its relationship to the response to antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 who are non-responders to two or more treatments.\",\"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is a major cause of acute hepatitis but also provokes chronic infection in immunocompromised patients. Although the pathogenesis and treatment outcome involve complex interplay between the virus and host, the nature of adaptive responses of HEV to the host immune system remain obscure at best. In this study, we used large-scale proteomic bioinformatics to profile characteristic mutations in human HEV isolates associated to ribavirin treatment failure, chronic hepatitis, hepatic failure or altered immunoreactivity. The prevalence of specific mutations was examined in a large number of protein sequences of ORF1 and ORF2 regions of the 3 major human-derived HEV genotypes (1, 3 and 4). By analyzing potential B, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes, we found that many of these mutations overlap with the predicted epitopes and are frequently present among the 3 HEV genotypes. These overlapping mutations mediate reduced antigenicity. Finally, by delineation of diversification and evolution of the underlying epitopes, we observe that most of these variants apparently evolved earlier in genotype 1 when compared with genotypes 3 and 4. These results indicate that HEV is under substantial evolutionary pressure to develop mutations enabling evasion of the host immune response and resistance to antiviral treatment. This indicates the existence of an ongoing evolutionary arms race between human immunity, antiviral medication and HEV.\",\"T-705 (favipiravir) is a potent inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of influenza viruses and no favipiravir-resistant virus has been isolated. Poliovirus RNA polymerase has been well characterized and isolation of resistant virus was examined in poliovirus.\",\"Chronic HCV infection has emerged as a complex multifaceted disease with manifestations extending beyond the liver. HCV plays a direct role in glucose metabolism leading to both insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. To evaluate the changes in the glycemic state following Sofosbuvir-based treatment regimens in diabetic HCV patients. Four hundred chronic hepatitis C patients who underwent Sofosbuvir-based treatment regimens were retrospectively screened. Sixty-five diabetic HCV patients only enrolled in our analysis. Baseline demographic and laboratory data were recorded. Pretreatment Transient elastography was performed. At 24-week post EOT (SVR24), Fasting Plasma glucose, and Hemoglobin A1c were re-evaluated and compared with baseline. All enrolled diabetic patients were responders. They showed statistically significant decline in Fasting Plasma glucose and Hemoglobin A1c values at SVR24. Whatever the degree of hepatic fibrosis, the level of Fasting Plasma glucose and Hemoglobin A1c decreased at SVR24 in comparison to baseline level. Fifty-one patients showed improvement in their Hemoglobin A1c values at SVR24 and this improvement was more likely to occur among patients with low Body mass index. The reduction in Fasting Plasma glucose >20 mg/dL (>1.1 mmol/L) and Hemoglobin A1c \\u22650.5% was not associated with age, gender or hepatic fibrosis stage. Sofosbuvir-based regimens are a highly efficient antiviral therapy for diabetic chronic HCV patients resulted in improvement in Fasting Plasma glucose and Hemoglobin A1c.\",\"People with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have failed treatment with an all-oral regimen represent a challenging treatment population. The present studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of grazoprevir, ruzasvir, and uprifosbuvir, with or without ribavirin, in participants who had failed an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen. C-SURGE (PN-3682-021) and C-CREST Part C (PN-3682-011 and -012) were open-label, multicenter studies. Participants who had previously relapsed following an NS5A inhibitor-containing all-oral regimen were retreated with grazoprevir 100 mg, ruzasvir 60 mg, and uprifosbuvir 450 mg alone for 24 weeks or with ribavirin for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virologic response (HCV RNA below the limit of quantitation [<15 IU/mL]) 12 weeks after treatment completion (SVR12). In C-SURGE, SVR12 was achieved by 49/49 (100%) and 43/44 (98%) genotype (GT)1 participants in the 24-week no ribavirin arm and the 16-week plus ribavirin arm (lost to follow-up, n = 1), respectively. In C-CREST Part C, SVR12 was achieved by 23/24 (96%) participants treated for 16 weeks with ribavirin (GT1, 2/2 [100%]; GT2, 13/14 [93%]; GT3, 8/8 [100%]). One participant with GT2 infection discontinued study medication after a single dose of grazoprevir, ruzasvir, and uprifosbuvir plus ribavirin due to serious adverse events of vomiting and tachycardia. The presence of baseline resistance-associated substitutions had no impact on SVR12. No participant who completed treatment in either study experienced virologic failure.\",\"The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, interaction potential, efficacy, and safety of the newest direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medication for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C are reviewed.\",\"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has emerged as a global health issue, but no approved medication is available. The nucleoside analogue 2'-C-methylcytidine (2CMC), a viral polymerase inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit infection with a variety of viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV). Here, we report that 2CMC significantly inhibits the replication of HEV in a subgenomic replication model and in a system using a full-length infectious virus. Importantly, long-term treatment with 2CMC did not result in a loss of antiviral potency, indicating a high barrier to drug resistance development. However, the combination of 2CMC with ribavirin, an off-label treatment for HEV, exerts antagonistic effects. Our results indicate that 2CMC serves as a potential antiviral drug against HEV infection.\",\"Little is known about the epidemiology and frequency of recombinant HCV genotype 2/1 strains, which may represent a challenge for direct antiviral therapy (DAA).

The aim of the study is the analysis of the antiviral therapy which is a combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin, considering various factors that will identify the predictors of the sustained virological response.\",\"In study TMC647055HPC2001, a 3-direct-acting-antiviral (DAA) regimen combining NS3/4A protease inhibitor simeprevir (SMV), non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor TMC647055/ritonavir (RTV) and NS5A inhibitor JNJ-56914845 resulted in high sustained virologic response 12 weeks after actual end of treatment (SVR12) in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-infected patients. SVR12 rates were generally lower in the 2-DAA regimen SMV + TMC647055/RTV with or without ribavirin. The objective of this study was to identify and characterise pre-existing and emerging resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in patients enrolled in study TMC647055HPC2001.\",\"From 2010, the landscape of hepatitis C therapeutics has been changed rapidly, and today we are standing at a cusp of a pharmacological revolution where highly effective and interferon (IFN)-free direct acting antivirals (DAAs) are already on the market. Such treatment paradigms attain 90-95% sustained virologic response (SVR; undetectable viral load at week 12 or 24 at the end of therapy) rates in treated individuals compared to 50-70% with treatment completion of dual-therapy-pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). As the major goal now for the hepatologists, clinicians, physicians, and health care workers is likely to eradicate hepatitis C infection in parallel to treatment, the demand is for a one-size-fits-all pill that could be prescribed beyond the limitations of hepatitis C genotype, viral load, previous treatment history, advanced hepatic manifestations (fibrosis, cirrhosis) and antiviral drug resistance. Although the new treatment strategies have shown high cure rates in clinical trials, such treatment paradigms are posing dilemmas too in real-world clinical practice. Therapy cost, treatment access to low and middle-income countries, treatment-emergent adverse events, lack of effective viral screening and disease progression simulation models are potential challenges in this prospect. This review article deeply overviews the challenges encountered while surmounting the burden of hepatitis C around the world.\",\"Patients chronically infected with genotype 3 hepatitis C virus (HCV) have faster disease progression and are less responsive to current direct-acting antiviral regimens than patients infected with other genotypes. We conducted an open-label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plus ribavirin in patients with genotype 3 HCV infection.\",\"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (3D[pol]) catalyzes viral RNA synthesis. Its characteristic low fidelity and absence of proofreading activity allow FMDV to rapidly mutate and adapt to dynamic environments. In this study, we used the structure of FMDV 3D[pol] in combination with previously reported results from similar picornaviral polymerases to design point mutations that would alter replication fidelity. In particular, we targeted Trp237 within conserved polymerase motif A because of the low reversion potential inherent in the single UGG codon. Using biochemical and genetic tools, we show that the replacement of tryptophan 237 with phenylalanine imparts higher fidelity, but replacements with isoleucine and leucine resulted in lower-fidelity phenotypes. Viruses containing these W237 substitutions show in vitro growth kinetics and plaque morphologies similar to those of the wild-type (WT) A24 Cruzeiro strain in BHK cells, and both high- and low-fidelity variants retained fitness during coinfection with the wild-type virus. The higher-fidelity W237F (W237F[HF]) mutant virus was more resistant to the mutagenic nucleoside analogs ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil than the WT virus, whereas the lower-fidelity W237I (W237I[LF]) and W237L[LF] mutant viruses exhibited lower ribavirin resistance. Interestingly, the variant viruses showed heterogeneous and slightly delayed growth kinetics in primary porcine kidney cells, and they were significantly attenuated in mouse infection experiments. These data demonstrate, for a single virus, that either increased or decreased RdRp fidelity attenuates virus growth in animals, which is a desirable feature for the development of safer and genetically more stable vaccine candidates.IMPORTANCE Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is the most devastating disease affecting livestock worldwide. Here, using structural and biochemical analyses, we have identified FMDV 3D[pol] mutations that affect polymerase fidelity. Recombinant FMDVs containing substitutions at 3D[pol] tryptophan residue 237 were genetically stable and displayed plaque phenotypes and growth kinetics similar to those of the wild-type virus in cell culture. We further demonstrate that viruses harboring either a W237F[HF] substitution or W237I[LF] and W237L[LF] mutations were highly attenuated in animals. Our study shows that obtaining 3D[pol] fidelity variants by protein engineering based on polymerase structure and function could be exploited for the development of attenuated FMDV vaccine candidates that are safer and more stable than strains obtained by selective pressure via mutagenic nucleotides or adaptation approaches.\",\"The optimal retreatment strategy for patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus who experience virologic failure after treatment with direct-acting antiviral-based therapies remains unclear. In this multicenter, open-label, phase 2 study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (400 mg/100 mg) plus weight-adjusted ribavirin administered for 24 weeks in patients who did not achieve sustained virologic response after prior treatment with direct-acting antiviral regimens that included the nucleotide analogue nonstructural protein 5B inhibitor sofosbuvir plus the nonstructural protein 5A inhibitor velpatasvir with or without the nonstructural protein 3/4A protease inhibitor voxilaprevir. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after the cessation of treatment. In total, 63 of 69 (91%; 95% confidence interval, 82%-97%) patients achieved sustained virologic response at 12 weeks, including 36 of 37 (97%; 95% confidence interval, 86%-100%) patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection, 13 of 14 (93%; 95% confidence interval, 66%-100%) patients with genotype 2 infection, and 14 of 18 (78%; 95% confidence interval, 52%-94%) patients with genotype 3 infection. Most adverse events were of mild or moderate severity. The most frequently reported adverse events were fatigue, nausea, headache, insomnia, and rash. One patient (1%) with genotype 1a infection discontinued all study drugs due to an adverse event (irritability).\",\"To assess the efficacy and safety of telaprevir (TVR) when used in combination with natural human interferon-\\u03b2 (IFN-\\u03b2) and ribavirin (RBV) for genotype 1 patients with depression compared to IFN-\\u03b2/RBV therapy in Japan. We also examined the efficacy of the TVR/IFN-\\u03b2/RBV therapy in treatment failure genotype 2 patients with depression.\",\"Multiple direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based regimens are currently approved that provide one or more interferon-free treatment options for hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes (G) 1-6. The choice of a DAA regimen, duration of therapy, and use of ribavirin depends on multiple viral and host factors, including HCV genotype, the detection of resistance-associated amino acid (aa) substitutions (RASs), prior treatment experience, and presence of cirrhosis. In regard to viral factors that may guide the treatment choice, the most important is the infecting genotype because a number of DAAs are genotype-designed. The potency and the genetic barrier may also impact the choice of treatment. One important and debated possible virologic factor that may negatively influence the response to DAAs is the presence of baseline RASs. Baseline resistance testing is currently not routinely considered or recommended for initiating HCV treatment, due to the overall high response rates (sustained virological response >90%) obtained. Exceptions are patients infected by HCV G1a when initiating treatment with simeprevir and elbasvir/grazoprevir or in those with cirrhosis prior to daclatasvir/sofosbuvir treatment because of natural polymorphisms demonstrated in sites of resistance. On the basis of these observations, first-line strategies should be optimized to overcome treatment failure due to HCV resistance.\",\"Pegylated interferon (PegIFN) is used in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients especially in resource limited countries. Treatment with PegIFN stimulates the expression of a number of host genes encoding enzymes with antiviral activities, including myxovirus resistance gene-A (MxA gene). MxA gene was found to have a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position -88 in the promoter region that affects the expression of MxA gene protein and was suggested to affect the treatment outcome. The aim of the work was to assess the relation between the SNP in the MxA gene and its impact on treatment of chronic HCV patients with PegIFN and ribavirin.\",\"To review the role and utility of baseline resistance testing with currently available and pipeline genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment.\",\"We have identified a series of 1-aryl-4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydrotriazines, structurally related to the antimalarial drug cycloguanil, as new inhibitors of influenza A and B virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) via targeting of the host dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme. Most analogues proved active against influenza B virus in the low micromolar range, and the best compounds (11, 13, 14 and 16) even reached the sub-micromolar potency of zanamivir (EC50 = 0.060 \\u03bcM), and markedly exceeded (up to 327 times) the antiviral efficacy of ribavirin. Activity was also observed for two influenza A strains, including a virus with the S31N mutant form of M2 proton channel, which is the most prevalent resistance mutation for amantadine. Importantly, the compounds displayed nanomolar activity against RSV and a superior selectivity index, since the ratio of cytotoxic to antiviral concentration was >10,000 for the three most active compounds 11, 14 and 16 (EC50 \\u223c0.008 \\u03bcM), far surpassing the potency and safety profile of the licensed drug ribavirin (EC50 = 5.8 \\u03bcM, SI > 43).\",\"Elbasvir (EBR; HCV NS5A inhibitor) and grazoprevir (GZR; HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor) are approved as a fixed-dose combination to treat patients chronically infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 4. During the development programme and supported by in vitro potency, the efficacy of EBR+GZR was assessed in HCV GT3-infected patients. This study's aim was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of 12 or 18 weeks of EBR+GZR with ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-na\\u00efve, noncirrhotic HCV GT3-infected patients. Randomized patients received open-label EBR (50 mg once daily) + GZR (100 mg once daily) + RBV. The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the sustained virologic response rates 12 weeks after the end of all study therapy (SVR12). SVR12 rates (95% confidence interval) were 45.0% (23.1, 68.5) and 57.1% (34.0, 78.2) after treatment with EBR+GZR+RBV for 12 weeks or 18 weeks, respectively. On-treatment virologic failure was observed in 41% (17 of 41) of patients. At virologic failure, resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) with a >five-fold shift in potency occurred in the NS3 region in six (35%) patients and in the NS5A region in 16 (94%) patients. The most common RAS at virologic failure was Y93H in NS5A which was identified in 13 of 17 (76%) patients. The efficacy of EBR+GZR+RBV was suboptimal in HCV GT3-infected patients due to a high rate of on-treatment virologic failure and treatment-emergent RASs which demonstrates an inadequate barrier to the development of GT3 resistance. However, rapid viral clearance demonstrated the antiviral activity of EBR+GZR+RBV in GT3-infected patients.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01717326.\",\"Direct acting antivirals are revolutionizing the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Specifically, the combination therapy sofosbuvir and velpatasvir offers a pangenotypic regimen with high sustained viral response (SVR). Areas covered: Reviewed here are the clinical trials that led to the FDA approval of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir combination therapy, the adverse events during registration trials, and drug-drug interactions. Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is a fixed dose regimen that is both interferon- and ribavirin-free. It is administered for 12 weeks as a once-a-day pill, covers all genotypes of hepatitis C, and achieves SVR >95% in non-cirrhotic patients and patients with compensated cirrhosis. Addition of ribavirin is recommended for patients with decompensated cirrhosis (CTP B or C). Baseline resistance-associated substitutions do not appear to impair ability to achieve SVR with an initial course of treatment. Expert commentary: Availability of this highly efficacious, well tolerated, all oral regimen formulated as a single pill, can potentially simplify hepatitis C treatment. Its utility as a pangenotypic regimen additionally limits resource utilization.\",\"We evaluated the transition of dominant resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) in hepatitis C virus during long-term follow-up after the failure of DAAs (direct acting antivirals)-based therapy. RASs in non-structure (NS)3/4A, NS5A, NS5B, and deletions in NS5A from 20 patients who failed simeprevir/pegylated-interferon/ribavirin (SMV/PEG-IFN/RBV) and 25 patients who failed daclatasvir/asunaprevir (DCV/ASV) treatment were examined by direct sequencing. With respect to SMV/PEG-IFN/RBV treatment, RAS was detected at D168 in NS3/4A but not detected in NS5A and NS5B at treatment failure in 16 of 20 patients. During the median follow-up period of 64 weeks, the RAS at D168 became less dominant in 9 of 16 patients. Among 25 DCV/ASV failures, RASs at D168, L31, and Y93 were found in 57.1%, 72.2%, and 76.9%, respectively. NS5A deletions were detected in 3 of 10 patients treated previously with SMV/PEG-IFN/RBV. The number of RASs in the breakthrough patients exceeded that in relapsers (mean 3.9 vs. 2.7, p < 0.05). RAS at D168 in NS3/4A became less dominant in 6 of 15 patients within 80 weeks. Y93H emerged at the time of relapse, then decreased gradually by 99% at 130 weeks post-treatment. Emerged RASs were associated with the clinical course of treatment and could not be detected during longer follow-up.\",\"The aim of this study was to characterize the treatment response and serious adverse events of ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir therapies in Japanese patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 (GT1). This retrospective study analyzed 240 Japanese HCV GT1 patients treated for 12 weeks with 90 mg of ledipasvir plus 400 mg of sofosbuvir daily. Sustained virological response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12) was achieved in 236 of 240 (98.3%) patients. Among treatment-na\\u00efve patients, SVR12 was achieved in 136 of 138 (98.6%) patients, and among treatment-experienced patients, SVR12 was achieved in 100 of 102 (98.0%) patients. In patients previously treated with peginterferon plus ribavirin with various HCV NS3/4A inhibitors, 100% SVR rates (25/25) were achieved. Two relapsers had HCV NS5A resistance-associated variants (RAVs), but no HCV NS5B-S282 was observed after they relapsed. We experienced two patients with cardiac events during treatment. In conclusion, combination of ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir for 12 weeks is a potential therapy for HCV GT1 patients. Caution is needed for HCV NS5A RAVs, which were selected by HCV NS5A inhibitors and cardiac adverse events.\",\"Directly-acting antivirals (DAA) have finally allowed all patients to be potentially cured from chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection. All-oral, Interferon (IFN)-free regimens are based upon the combination of molecules targeting different sites of the HCV replication process. Three classes of DAA exist: protease inhibitors (anti-NS3/4A), RNA-dependent polymerase inhibitors (anti-NS5B) and anti-NS5A inhibitors, which are characterized by different antiviral potency and barrier to resistance and therefore are usually combined in different treatment schedules. Treatment regimens are still largely dependent on HCV genotype and stage of liver disease, with duration ranging between 12 weeks and 24 weeks, while overall treatment efficacy has climbed to nearly 95% in most patient groups, including historically difficult-to-treat categories (HCV genotype 1, advanced liver disease). The elimination of IFN has allowed safe and efficacious treatment of patients formerly contraindicated to antiviral therapy, such as decompensated cirrhosis and solid organ transplant recipients. Availability of potent and safe antiviral drugs combined with improvement of worldwide access to treatment could finally lead to HCV elimination in the next decades.\",\"Inclusion of direct-acting antivirals into clinical practice in patients with chronic HCV (CHC) has been a milestone in medicine.\",\"Clinical studies have shown high rates of sustained virological response (hepatitis C virus [HCV] RNA <15 IU/mL) at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) in patients with genotype 1b infection with and without cirrhosis who received coformulated ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir, plus dasabuvir, without ribavirin, for 12 weeks. In this study, we aimed to assess 8-week treatment with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir, plus dasabuvir, without ribavirin in patients infected with HCV genotype 1b without cirrhosis.\",\"First-generation protease-inhibitors (PIs) have suboptimal efficacy in GT-1 patients with advanced liver disease, and patients experiencing treatment failure may require urgent retreatment. Our objective was to analyse the real-life efficacy of interferon (IFN)-free retreatment after PI-failure, and the role of genotypic-resistance-testing (GRT) in guiding retreatment choice.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy that is highly efficacious, pangenotypic, with a high barrier to resistance and short treatment duration is desirable. The efficacy and safety of 8- and 12-week treatments with glecaprevir (ABT-493; NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and pibrentasvir (ABT-530; NS5A inhibitor) were evaluated in non-cirrhotic patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection.\",\"Influenza is a highly contagious viral infection associated with excessive hospitalizations and deaths throughout the world. Continuous antigenic shift and drift is not only responsible for this devastating effect of influenza but also causes ineffectiveness of antiviral drugs and vaccines. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of ribavirin, oseltamivir, and amantadine drugs in vitro against nine influenza A isolates collected during June 2012-August 2013 from different slums in Dhaka city. The effectiveness of these drugs was determined by measuring the inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect on MDCK cells through MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide). Our data showed that all nine influenza isolates (6 H1N1 pdm09 and 3 H3N2 subtypes) were completely susceptible to ribavirin (The 50% effective concentrations, EC50 3.0 \\u00b5g/ml) and oseltamivir (EC50 0.35 \\u00b5g/ml). When influenza A infection was challenged with amantadine drug, eight out of nine isolates (88%) demonstrated susceptibility to amantadine drug (EC50 0.30 \\u00b5g/ml) while one H1N1 pdm09 isolate exhibited higher EC50 value (>10 \\u00b5g/ml) beyond the cell tolerance level of drug (>5 \\u00b5g/ml). Genetic analysis of transmembrane matrix protein 2 (M2), which is a target for the amantadine drug and vital for viral replication, showed a substitution of amino acid at position 31(S31 N) of that amantadine-resistant isolate indicating the possible reason of amantadine drug resistance.\",\"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays an important role in the immunity to hepatitis C virus (HCV). Insofar as IL-10 variants are associated with altered levels of IL-10, previous studies that examined the association of IL-10 polymorphisms with the susceptibility to and progression of chronic HCV, and response to anti-viral treatment were inconsistent. We investigated the association between common IL-10 variants in the intron and the promotor region with HCV and associated features.\",\"Favipiravir (T-705) is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent that has been approved in Japan for the treatment of influenza virus infections. T-705 also inhibits the replication of various RNA viruses, including chikungunya virus (CHIKV). We demonstrated earlier that the K291R mutation in the F1 motif of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of CHIKV is responsible for low-level resistance to T-705. Interestingly, this lysine is highly conserved in the RdRp of positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses. To obtain insights into the unique broad-spectrum antiviral activity of T-705, we explored the role of this lysine using another +ssRNA virus, namely, coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Introduction of the corresponding K-to-R substitution in the CVB3 RdRp (K159R) resulted in a nonviable virus. Replication competence of the K159R variant was restored by spontaneous acquisition of an A239G substitution in the RdRp. A mutagenesis analysis at position K159 identified the K159M variant as the only other viable variant which had also acquired the A239G substitution. The K159 substitutions markedly decreased the processivity of the purified viral RdRp, which was restored by the introduction of the A239G mutation. The K159R A239G and K159M A239G variants proved, surprisingly, more susceptible than the wild-type virus to T-705 and exhibited lower fidelity in polymerase assays. Furthermore, the K159R A239G variant was found to be highly attenuated in mice. We thus demonstrate that the conserved lysine in the F1 motif of the RdRp of +ssRNA viruses is involved in the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of T-705 and that it is a key amino acid for the proper functioning of the enzyme.IMPORTANCE In this study, we report the key role of a highly conserved lysine residue of the viral polymerase in the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of favipiravir (T-705) against positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Substitutions of this conserved lysine have a major negative impact on the functionality of the RdRp. Furthermore, we show that this lysine is involved in the fidelity of the RdRp and that the RdRp fidelity influences the sensitivity of the virus for the antiviral efficacy of T-705. Consequently, these results provide insights into the mechanism of the antiviral activity of T-705 and may lay the basis for the design of novel chemical scaffolds that may be endowed with a more potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity than that of T-705.\",\"The efficacy of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment has increased over the last 5 years to nearly 100% for many patient groups. Patients with genotype (GT) 3 HCV infection, however, and specifically cirrhotic or treatment-experienced patients, have lower sustained virologic response (SVR) rates than patients with other GTs. Because GT 3 presents more clinical challenges than other GTs, this review focuses on the evolution and efficacy of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment options for HCV GT 3 infection after the historical standard of care with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Our objective was to review the SVR rates with available and late-pipeline DAAs for HCV GT 3 infection and discuss challenges with successful GT 3 treatment. Authors performed a literature search of the PubMed/MEDLINE database (inception to March 27, 2017) and narrowed the field to clinical trials published in English. Trials that evaluated alternative treatments, non-DAA historical treatment, and DAAs not currently indicated for HCV were excluded. Trials only involving patients with human immunodeficiency virus/HCV coinfection were also excluded. Additional trials were identified from a review of the ClinicalTrials.gov database. Authors further identified references from a review of literature citations and reviewed annual meeting abstracts from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver for pipeline and real-world GT 3 data. Phase III trial data were not available to support all GT 3 treatment recommendations found in the guidelines. The SVR rates were lower in treatment-experienced and cirrhotic patients with GT 3 than other HCV populations. Treatment failure was associated with resistance to current treatment regimens. Clinical studies included patients with various levels of advanced liver disease, but few patients with decompensated cirrhosis were represented. Recent advances in pharmacologic treatment with DAAs have greatly increased SVR rates in patients with all HCV GTs, but SVR rates for treatment-experienced cirrhotic patients with GT 3 are lower than for other GTs. Given the limited data and observed SVR rates in this patient population, the optimal therapy for patients with decompensated cirrhotic GT 3 HCV infection is not yet established. Newer agents and recommendations regarding baseline resistance are likely to evolve treatment strategies in the near future.\",\"This multinational (Taiwan, South Korea, Russia) phase 3 study evaluated the all-oral, ribavirin-free, fixed-dose combination (DCV-TRIO) of daclatasvir (NS5A inhibitor) 30 mg, asunaprevir (NS3 inhibitor) 200 mg, and beclabuvir (NS5B inhibitor) 75 mg, in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype-1 infection, with or without compensated cirrhosis.\",\"We assessed the broadly used, off-label combination of sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, simeprevir, and ribavirin in direct-acting antiviral-experienced patients, as recommended in current guidelines despite scarce data. After 24 weeks' treatment, sustained virological response 12 weeks after the end of treatment was achieved in 6 patients (60%). Two cirrhotic patients relapsed and 2 discontinued treatment due to serious adverse events.\",\"The need to test for resistance associated substitutions (RAS) has been intensively debated in the past two years. In the absence of pangenotypic combinations, it seems reasonable that, if available, RAS testing in the NS5A gene at baseline for genotypes 1a and 3 may help to avoid overtreatment in terms of ribavirin usage and/or prolonged treatment duration. When patients fail treatment, RAS testing may also be useful to guide the selection of the new regimen, especially for those that need urgent retreatment and that have failed a combination including an NS5A inhibitor. However, there are new drugs in the pipeline that in combination are pangenotypic, very potent and with a high genetic barrier to resistance. In this new scenario, RAS testing may not play such an important role.\",\"Nucleoside analogues are among the most known drugs commonly used in antiviral and anticancer chemotherapies. Among them, those featuring a five-membered ring nucleobase are of utmost interest such as the anti-cancer agent AICAR or the anti-viral drug ribavirin. Despite its low activity in vitro in different cell lines, AICAR is under clinical development for several pathologies, thanks to its original mode of action. Indeed, AICAR induced autophagy cell death and is able, following this mechanism, to circumvent resistance to apoptotic drugs including kinase inhibitors currently on the market. To improve the activity of AICAR, we report herein an efficient synthesis of new series of sulfonamide-4-substituted-1,2,3-triazolyl nucleosides using a Cu-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. All these molecules have been fully characterized and evaluated against two aggressive tumor cell lines, RCC4 and MDA-MB-231. Among them, nucleoside analogue 5i belonging to the ribose series was found to be 19 to 66-fold more active than AICAR. Western blot analyses on RCC4 cells showed that 5i displayed an interesting mode of action by inducing both apoptosis and autophagy cell death, making therefore this class of molecules highly promising for further hit-to-lead optimization.\",\"Hepatitis C is a leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma responsible for almost 700,000 deaths worldwide annually. Until 2014, management of HCV infections was based on interferon alfa containing regimens, with efficacy of 40-70% and a high adverse event rate. Interferon-free therapeutic options improved sustained viral response (SVR) rate to >90% and safety profile to placebo-like levels. Areas covered: This article describes all-oral regimen consisting of three direct acting antivirals (DAA) - ombitasvir (OBV), paritaprevir (PTV) and dasabuvir (DSV), which in clinical practice is boosted with ritonavir (r) and sometimes with ribavirin (RBV). This combination is registered for treatment of patients infected with HCV genotype 1 and 4. We focused on the regimen characteristics, pharmacokinetics, risk of resistance as well as efficacy and safety in clinical trials and real world studies. Expert commentary: Combination of OBV/PTV/r\\u00b1DSV\\u00b1RBV provides SVR rate of about 95% and good safety profile even in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis and failure with previous therapy. Currently it should be of particular value in areas with a predominance of genotype 1b infections. Due to the complexity and risk of drug to drug interactions, it will probably be replaced in coming few years with pangenotypic combinations of next generation DAAs.\",\"The optimal retreatment regimen for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who failed interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy is undetermined. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 12-week retreatment with ledipasvir (LDV) and sofosbuvir (SOF) with add-on ribavirin (RBV) for patients who previously failed to respond to HCV-NS5A inhibitor, daclatasvir (DCV), and HCV-NS3 inhibitor, asunaprevir (ASV), therapy.\",\"Patients with genotype-1 hepatitis C virus infection who have failed to respond to standard therapy or who relapse following treatment may be considered for an interferon-free regimen incorporating a nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor. Sustained virologic response (SVR) with these regimens is typically >90%, but this is reduced in patients with NS5A resistance. European Association for Study of the Liver guidelines recommend simeprevir + sofosbuvir \\u00b1 ribavirin (SMV+SOF\\u00b1R) for re-treating patients failing an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen. An alternative strategy would be to test for NS5A resistance prior to treatment, with therapy optimized based on the results. This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of this strategy.\",\"Sofosbuvir is a nucleoside analogue inhibitor of the HCV NS5B polymerase approved for treatment of HCV-infected patients in combination with ribavirin or with other antivirals. It has activity against all genotypes of HCV. Resistance to sofosbuvir in genotype-1 and -2 HCV is conferred by the S282T substitution in NS5B.\",\"Background NS3 protease inhibitors (PIs) were the first direct antiviral agents used for the treatment of hepatitis C virus. The combination of second-wave PIs with other direct antiviral agents enabled the use of interferon-free regimens for chronic kidney disease patients on dialysis and renal transplant (RTx) recipients, populations in which the use of interferon and ribavirin is limited. However, the occurrence of PI resistance-associated variants (RAVs), both baseline and induced by therapy, has resulted in the failure of many treatment strategies. Methods The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of PI RAVs and of the Q80K polymorphism in chronic kidney disease patients on hemodialysis and RTx recipients. Direct sequencing of the NS3 protease was performed in 67 patients (32 hemodialysis and 35 RTx).Results RAVs to PIs were detected in 18% of the patients: V55A (9%), V36L (1.5%), T54S (1.5%), S122N (1.5%), I170L (1.5%), and M175L (1.5%). Only 1.5% of the patients carried the Q80K polymorphism. The frequency of these mutations was more than two times higher in patients infected with GT1a (25%) than GT1b (9.7%) (P=0.1). The mutations were detected in 20% of treatment-naive patients and in 15.6% of peginterferon/ribavirin-experienced patients (P=0.64). Furthermore, no mutation that would confer high resistance to PIs was detected.Conclusion The Q80K polymorphism was rare in the population studied. The occurrence of RAVs was common, with predominance in GT1a. However, the variants observed were those associated with a low level of resistance to PIs, facilitating the use of these drugs in this special group of patients.\",\"We previously reported results of interferon (IFN)-free daclatasvir and asunaprevir for the treatment of recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection after liver transplantation (LT). Here we report three patients who achieved viral response with no effect on the blood concentrations of immunosuppressive agents following sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir treatment. The first patient was a 68-year-old female with HCV-related liver cirrhosis who failed to respond to pegylated-IFN and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) after living donor LT. She had been treated with 50 mg/day of cyclosporine. The second was a 63-year-old male with HCV-related liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma who failed to respond to PEG-IFN/RBV after living donor LT. He had been treated with 50 mg/day of cyclosporine. The third was a 63-year-old female with HCV-related liver cirrhosis. She had been treated with tacrolimus. High alanine aminotransferase levels persisted after LT. Liver biopsy examination revealed active hepatitis or chronic rejection. Therefore, sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir therapy was started. However, the combination treatment was stopped at 4 weeks due to development of interstitial pneumonia. Serum HCV RNA became negative at the time treatment was discontinued and remained negative 12 weeks after cessation of therapy in all three cases. Sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir treatment showed a remarkable viral response with little effect on blood levels of immunosuppressive agents for recurrent HCV genotype 1 infection after LT.\",\"Treatment of hepatitis C is based on a national consensus guideline updated six-monthly according to local availability and affordability of approved therapies through a transparent allocation system in Hungary. This updated guideline incorporates some special new aspects, including recommendations for screening, diagnostics, use and allocation of novel direct acting antiviral agents. Indication of therapy in patients with no contraindication is based on demonstration of viral replication with consequent inflammation and/or fibrosis in the liver. Non-invasive methods (elastographies and biochemical methods) are preferred for liver fibrosis staging. The budget allocated for these patients is limited. Therefore, expensive novel direct acting antiviral combinations as first line treatment are reimbursed only, if the freely available, but less effective and more toxic pegylated interferon plus ribavirin dual therapy deemed to prone high chance of adverse events and/or low chance of cure. Priority is given to those with urgent need based on a pre-defined scoring system reflecting mainly the stage of the liver disease, but considering also additional factors, i.e., hepatic decompensation, other complications, activity and progression of liver disease, risk of transmission and other special issues. Approved treatments are restricted to the most cost-effective combinations based on the cost per sustained virological response value in different patient categories with consensus amongst treating physicians, the National Health Insurance Fund and patient's organizations. Interferon-free treatments and shorter therapy durations are preferred. Orv. Hetil., 2017, 158(Suppl. 1), 3-22.\",\"Persons with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are at risk of progressive liver disease, cirrhosis, and decompensation.

We report a treatment-na\\u00efve, non-cirrhotic patient in whom the relapse of genotype 1b HCV infection was accompanied by de novo cryoglobulinemic vasculitis and glomerulonephritis, requiring hemodialysis for acute renal failure. Sequence analysis revealed several resistance-associated variants in the HCV NS5a gene but not in NS3/4A. The patient's vasculitis was successfully treated with immunosuppression and plasmapheresis, followed by retreatment of HCV with a combination of sofosbuvir, simeprevir, and ribavirin. The patient achieved sustained virological response, recovered his renal function, and remains in remission from cryoglobulinemia.\",\"Favipiravir (T-705) is a new antiviral drug with strong inhibitory activity on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of most RNA virus genome. All the influenza viruses have been shown fully sensitive to this new antiviral, including genetic strains to neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir) resistance. Its mechanism of action lies in blocking viral replication and induction of lethal mutagenesis which determines the loss of infective activity of influenza viruses. Its activity is particularly intense in the respiratory tract, decreasing the viral load to non-infectious levels. Clinical trials in humans have not yet completed but have very favourable results. It seems that the best therapy would be the combination of favipiravir with oseltamivir; both antivirals are synergistic and avoid the emergence of resistance.\",\"The current medical treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is pegylated interferon plus ribavirin, but just 50% of genotype 1 HCV patients and about 80% of HCV genotype 3 patients are treated completely. Recently, the rs12979860 C/T polymorphism, which is located 3 kb upstream of the IL28b gene that codes IFN\\u03bb3, shows a powerful association in response to the treatment in HCV patients.\",\"Among patients with chronic hepatitis C, 20-30% develop hepatic cirrhosis and its complications within 30 years.

This study aimed to clarify the efficacy and safety of interferon-free therapy with sofosbuvir and ledipasvir without ribavirin for 12 weeks in Japanese patients with HCV genotype 1b infection after living donor liver transplantation.\",\"Although direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have demonstrated high rates of sustained virologic response, virologic failure may still occur, potentially leading to the emergence of viral resistance, which can decrease the effectiveness of subsequent treatment. Treatment options for patients who failed previous DAA-containing regimens, particularly those with nonstructural protein 5A inhibitors, are limited and remain an area of unmet medical need. This phase 2, open-label study (MAGELLAN-1) evaluated the efficacy and safety of glecaprevir (GLE) + pibrentasvir (PIB) \\u00b1 ribavirin (RBV) in HCV genotype 1-infected patients with prior virologic failure to HCV DAA-containing therapy. A total of 50 patients without cirrhosis were randomized to three arms: 200 mg GLE + 80 mg PIB (arm A), 300 mg GLE + 120 mg PIB with 800 mg once-daily RBV (arm B), or 300 mg GLE + 120 mg PIB without RBV (arm C). By intent-to-treat analysis, sustained virologic response at posttreatment week 12 was achieved in 100% (6/6, 95% confidence interval 61-100), 95% (21/22, 95% confidence interval 78-99), and 86% (19/22, 95% confidence interval 67-95) of patients in arms A, B, and C, respectively. Virologic failure occurred in no patients in arm A and in 1 patient each in arms B and C (two patients were lost to follow-up in arm C). The majority of adverse events were mild in severity; no serious adverse events related to study drug and no relevant laboratory abnormalities in alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, or hemoglobin were observed.\",\"GS-9256 is an inhibitor of HCV NS3 protease with a macrocyclic structure and novel phosphinic acid pharmacophore.\",\"Despite the excellent efficacy of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) reported in clinical trials, virological failures can occur, often associated with the development of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs). This study aimed to characterize the presence of clinically relevant RASs to all classes in real-life DAA failures.\",\"Elbasvir/grazoprevir demonstrated high sustained virologic response rates 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12) across five clinical trials in subjects infected with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1, including those with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), and GT4. Despite favorable results overall, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encountered challenging regulatory issues due to the limitations of clinical trial data in certain subpopulations. In GT1a-infected subjects, baseline NS5A resistance-associated polymorphisms emerged as the strongest baseline characteristic associated with diminished SVR12 rates following 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir treatment. The decision for recommending 16 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir + ribavirin in this population and for extrapolating these recommendations to patients with advanced CKD was based on benefit-versus-risk analyses using the available data. Conversely, FDA had insufficient data to define a specific elbasvir/grazoprevir treatment regimen for GT1a-infected subjects with baseline NS5A resistance-associated polymorphisms who failed prior treatment with pegylated interferon + ribavirin (PR) and either boceprevir, simeprevir, or telaprevir. For GT4 PR-experienced patients, leveraging of data in related populations and additional pooled analyses were employed to support labeling for elbasvir/grazoprevir. This article describes FDA's rationale for labeling determinations in situations where limited data made these decisions challenging.\",\"Viral hepatitis, an inflammatory liver disease, is caused by various genotypes of hepatitis C viruses (HCV). Hepatitis C slowly sprouts into fibrosis, which progresses to cirrhosis. Over a prolonged period of time compensated cirrhosis can advance to decompensated cirrhosis culminating in hepatic failure and death. Conventional treatment of HCV involves the administration of interferons. However, association of interferon with the adverse drug reactions led to the development of novel anti-HCV drugs given as monotherapy or in combination with the other drugs. Advances in drug delivery systems (DDS) improved the pharmacokinetic profile and stability of drugs, ameliorated tissue damages on extravasation and increased the targeting of affected sites. Liposomes and lipid based vehicles have been employed with polyethylene glycol (PEG) so as to stabilize the formulations as PEG drug complex. Sofosbuvir, a novel anti-HCV drug, is administered as monotherapy or in combination with daclatasvir, ledipasivir, protease inhibitors, ribavirin and interferon for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 2 and 3. These drug combinations are highly effective in eradicating the interferon resistance, recurrent HCV infection in liver transplant, concurrent HIV infection and preventing interferon related adverse effects. Further investigations to improve drug targeting and identification of new drug targets are highly warranted due to the rapid emergence of drug resistance in HCV.\",\"Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) combinations are potent and effective drugs currently recommended for treatment of chronic HCV infection. Difficult to treat genotypes are the most important predictors of treatment failure. We report a case of DAA treatment failure in an HCV-infected patient carrying a recombinant genotype 2k/1b. This strain, first isolated from a Russian patient in 2002, has now been observed for the first time in Italy.\",\"The current standard of care for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a combination of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). Most HCV patients treated with these drugs achieve viral elimination, but 1% to 15% fail to attain this objective. Treatment failures are usually related to relapse, and less often to on-treatment viral breakthrough. HCV drug resistant associated substitutions are detected in most patients who do not eliminate the virus. The risk of developing these variants depends on host- and virus-related factors, the properties of the drugs used, and the treatment strategies applied. Patients who carry Resistant Associated Substitutions (RASs) may not obtain benefits from treatment, and are at a risk of disease progression. Whether HCV RASs persist depends on their type: NS3-4A variants often disappear gradually after DAA therapy is stopped, whereas NS5A variants tend to persist for more than 2 years. The best way to prevent emergence of resistant variants is to eliminate the virus at the first treatment using highly potent DAAs with genetic barriers to resistance. For those who fail an NS5A inhibitor, deferral of treatment is recommended pending the availability of additional data if they do not have cirrhosis or reasons for urgent re-treatment. If re-treatment is needed, the most commonly used strategy is sofosbuvir as backbone therapy plus a drug from a class other than that previously used, for 24 weeks. Unless it is contraindicated, weight-based ribavirin should also be added. If available, nucleotide-based (eg, sofosbuvir) triple or quadruple DAA regimens may be considered. The optimal treatment for patients who fail an NS5A inhibitor and those with multidrug-resistant variants remains to be defined, and research efforts should continue to focus on treatment for these patients.\",\"Respiratory viruses (influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus) represent the most common causes of respiratory viral infections in immunocompromised patients. Also, these infections may be more severe in immunocompromised patients than in the general population. Early diagnosis and treatment of viral infections continue to be of paramount importance in immunocompromised patients; because once viral replication and invasive infections are evident, prognosis can be grave. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the main antiviral agents used for the treatment of respiratory viral infections in immunocompromised patients and review of the new agents in the pipeline. Expert commentary: Over the past decade, important diagnostic advances, specifically, the use of rapid molecular testing has helped close the gap between clinical scenarios and pathogen identification and enhanced early diagnosis of viral infections and understanding of the role of prolonged shedding and viral loads. Advancements in novel antiviral therapeutics with high resistance thresholds and effective immunization for preventable infections in immunocompromised patients are needed.\",\"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within or near interferon lambda 4 (IFNL4) gene located upstream of IFNL3 are associated with response to anti-HCV therapy both in interferon (IFN)-based and IFN-free regimens. IFNL4 encodes IFN\\u03bb4, a newly discovered type III IFN, and its expression is controlled by rs368234815-TT/\\u0394G, which is in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with other tag SNPs within or near IFNL4 such as rs12979860 and rs8099917. Intrahepatic expression levels of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) affect the responsiveness to IFN\\u03b1 and are also associated with IFNL4 genotype. However, IFNL4 expressions and its role in intrinsic antiviral innate immunity remain unclear. This study evaluated the effect of IFNL4 on intrahepatic ISG expression and investigated its relationship with treatment outcomes in liver samples obtained from 49 chronic hepatitis C patients treated with pegylated (PEG)-IFN/ribavirin therapy. IFNL4 mRNA was detected in 11 of 22 patients with IFNL4-unfavorable SNPs but not in patients with favorable genotypes. IFNL4 expression was associated with non-response to PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy. Intrahepatic expression of antiviral ISGs (ISG15 and MX1) was significantly higher in IFNL4-unfavorable patients with detectable IFNL4 mRNA than in patients with undetectable IFNL4 mRNA, whereas the expression of suppressive ISGs (RNF125, SOCS1, SOCS3, and RNF11) was lower in patients with detectable IFNL4 mRNA. In summary, intrahepatic expression of IFNL4 was associated with increased antiviral ISG expression and decreased suppressive ISG expression at baseline, resulting in poor responsiveness to IFN\\u03b1-based therapy in HCV infection.\",\"Influenza management and surveillance programs in Japan possess several unique features. The national influenza surveillance is affiliated with National Epidemiological Surveillance for Infectious Diseases (NESID) and features sentinel outpatient surveillance, virological surveillance, and reports on hospitalization, mortality, and influenza-associated encephalopathy. Of note, information on the number of student absences and class/grade/school closures due to influenza are also reported to the government and made publically available. A private online influenza surveillance portal by volunteer doctors provides a real-time information source for the Japanese clinicians and the general public. For influenza treatment, three classes of drugs are approved and covered by national medical insurance in Japan: M2 inhibitors, neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), and a polymerase inhibitor. Four NAIs, oseltamivir, zanamivir, laninamivir, and peramivir, are licensed in Japan and are prescribed to seven to eight million patients annually. NAIs are prescribed to any influenza outpatient rather than being limited to severe cases. The majority (80-95 %) of patients start the treatment within 48 h of onset. Laninamivir and peramivir were used almost solely in Japan, until the approval of the latter drug by the FDA. Observational studies showed that the two drugs have equal effectiveness as oseltamivir and zanamivir. The Japanese approach to influenza surveillance and management has facilitated bringing new influenza antivirals to the markets and has driven innovative research in this field. New classes of antivirals, including polymerase inhibitors and cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, provide novel tools for treatment of influenza in Japan and the rest of the world.\",\"Daclatasvir is a nonstructural protein 5A inhibitor with potent activity against hepatitis C virus genotypes 1-6 in vitro, and asunaprevir is a nonstructural protein 3 protease inhibitor with activity against genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6. Despite a 90% sustained virologic response (SVR) rate, the SVR rate in patients with baseline NS5A-L31/Y93H polymorphisms decreased to around 40%. Therefore, an alternative regimen under the consideration of cost-effectiveness would be important. Whether the addition of ribavirin could improve the SVR rate among this group of patients remains unknown and hence our case series was reported.\",\"Treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 (GT3) is a medical priority. All-oral treatment of HCV GT3 with daclatasvir (DCV) and sofosbuvir (SOF), with or without ribavirin (RBV), is recommended by several treatment guidelines. The impact of HCV minority populations at amino acid positions in NS5A and NS5B associated with drug resistance on response to DCV+SOF\\u00b1RBV was assessed in SOF-naive and SOF-experienced HCV patients.\",\"The development of direct-acting oral agents has dramatically changed the treatment strategy of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Here we aimed to reveal the efficacy and safety of daclatasvir (DCV) and asunaprevir (ASV) for recurrent HCV genotype 1 infection after liver transplantation (LT).\",\"Targeting bacterial virulence mechanisms without compromising bacterial growth is a promising strategy to prevent drug resistance. LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs) possess structural conservation across bacterial species and regulate virulence in numerous pathogens, making them attractive targets for antimicrobial agents. We targeted AphB, a Vibrio cholerae LTTR, which regulates the expression of genes encoding cholera toxin and toxin-co-regulated pilus for inhibitor designing. Since AphB ligand is unknown, we followed a molecular fragment-based approach for ligand designing using FDA-approved drugs and subsequent screen to identify molecules that exhibited high-affinity binding to AphB ligand-binding pocket. Among the identified compounds, ribavirin, an anti-viral drug, antagonized AphB functions. Ribavirin perturbed Vibrio cholerae pathogenesis in animal models. The inhibitory effects of the drug was limited to the bacteria expressing wild type AphB, but not its constitutively active mutant (AphBN100E), which represents the ligand-bound state, suggesting that ribavirin binds to the active site of AphB to exert its inhibitory role and there exists no AphB-independent mechanism of its action. Similarly, ribavirin suppressed the functions of Salmonella Typhi LTTR Hrg, indicating its broad spectrum efficacy. Moreover, ribavirin did not affect the bacterial viability in culture. This study cites an example of drug repurposing for anti-infective therapy.\",\"Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir combination treatment in phase III clinical trials resulted in sustained viral suppression in 94-99% of patients. This study characterized drug resistance in treatment failures, which may help to inform retreatment options.\",\"The presence of baseline NS5A resistance-associated variants (RAVs) impacted treatment response in HCV genotype 1a (GT1a)-infected patients treated with elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) for 12 weeks, but not patients treated with EBR/GZR and ribavirin (RBV) for 16 weeks.\",\"During the last 5 years, the availability of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents has revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Compared with interferon/ribavirin-the previous standard of care-DAA combination regimens offer improved sustained virological response (SVR) rates, shorter treatment durations of 8-24 weeks, convenient once-daily single-tablet formulations and more favourable tolerability profiles. HCV treatment is complex, and the choice of therapy must consider a complex range of factors, including baseline viral load, fibrosis stage, the HCV genotype and subgenotype, and the presence of resistance-associated substitutions at baseline. Globally, HCV genotype 1 predominates, and there are extensive data and various treatment options available for this genotype. Genotypes 2-6 are prevalent and may even predominate in different geographical regions, reflecting diverse factors including human migration patterns and unsafe use of injection drugs and blood products. Such factors are themselves influenced by socio-economic factors, and poor regions often have the greatest unmet need for effective HCV therapies. The latest pan-genotypic DAA combination regimens provide the potential to eradicate HCV around the globe, regardless of genotype, hence minimizing the need for virological testing services, which often are unavailable in poorer regions. Economics inevitably remain a barrier to access, and extensive cooperation will be required between clinical organisations and pharmaceutical manufacturers to agree appropriate pricing policies, especially in poorer economic regions. This review considers key data and treatment guidelines for DAA therapies, including pan-genotypic combination regimens, in the context of regional differences in HCV genotype and socio-economic factors.\",\"Treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C who failed the triple therapy with first generation of protease inhibitors is not still defined. The combined use of sofosbuvir (SOF) and daclatasvir (DCV) seems to be promising due to higher genetic barrier, good tolerance and effectiveness.\",\"Use of interferon and ribavirin to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in kidney transplant recipients is limited because of the risk for allograft rejection and poor tolerability.\",\"The efficacy of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) could be attenuated by the presence of resistance-associated variants (RAVs). The aim of this study was to investigate the natural prevalence of RAVs among Chinese HCV genotype 1b patients and analyze the efficacy of pegylated interferon (PegIFN)/ribavirin (RBV) therapy in patients with and without RAVs at baseline.\",\"This review paper summarizes the epidemiology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and chronic HCV infection, including HCV virology and treatment regimens. Specifically, we focus on the evolution of past, current, and future HCV treatment options, the reasons for treatment failure, and the impact of resistance-associated variants on treatment success.\",\"The rapid evolution of drug resistance remains a critical public health concern. The treatment of influenza A virus (IAV) has proven particularly challenging, due to the ability of the virus to develop resistance against current antivirals and vaccines. Here, we evaluate a novel antiviral drug therapy, favipiravir, for which the mechanism of action in IAV involves an interaction with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase resulting in an effective increase in the viral mutation rate. We used an experimental evolution framework, combined with novel population genetic method development for inference from time-sampled data, to evaluate the effectiveness of favipiravir against IAV. Evaluating whole genome polymorphism data across 15 time points under multiple drug concentrations and in controls, we present the first evidence for the ability of IAV populations to effectively adapt to low concentrations of favipiravir. In contrast, under high concentrations, we observe population extinction, indicative of mutational meltdown. We discuss the observed dynamics with respect to the evolutionary forces at play and emphasize the utility of evolutionary theory to inform drug development.\",\"Vaniprevir is a macrocyclic hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural (NS)3/4A protease inhibitor. The objective of these phase 3 multicenter, open-label trials was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vaniprevir + peginterferon alfa-2b + ribavirin (PR) in Japanese patients with HCV genotype (GT)1 infection who had previously failed treatment with interferon-based regimens.\",\"Simeprevir (SMV)-based triple therapy is an effective retreatment option following failure of telaprevir (TVR)-based triple therapy. However, it is unclear whether the persistence of resistance-associated variants (RAVs) induced by TVR-based therapy may reduce the treatment effect of SMV-based therapy.\",\"Elbasvir (an NS5A inhibitor) and grazoprevir (an NS3/4A protease inhibitor) are direct-acting antiviral agents recently approved in the United States for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 and 4 infections, as a fixed-dose combination. Trials of elbasvir and grazoprevir, with or without ribavirin, demonstrated high rates of sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment ended (SVR12). However, 12 weeks of treatment with elbasvir and grazoprevir failed in a small proportion of patients with HCV genotype 1 infection. We summarize findings from independent US Food and Drug Administration analyses of drug resistance data from trials of elbasvir and grazoprevir, with and without ribavirin.\",\"Influenza viruses cause seasonal epidemics and pandemic outbreaks associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and a huge cost. Since resistance to the existing anti-influenza drugs is rising, innovative inhibitors with a different mode of action are urgently needed. The influenza polymerase complex is widely recognized as a key drug target, given its critical role in virus replication and high degree of conservation among influenza A (of human or zoonotic origin) and B viruses. We here review the major progress that has been made in recent years in unravelling the structure and functions of this protein complex, enabling structure-aided drug design toward the core regions of the PA endonuclease, PB1 polymerase, or cap-binding PB2 subunit. Alternatively, inhibitors may target a protein-protein interaction site, a cellular factor involved in viral RNA synthesis, the viral RNA itself, or the nucleoprotein component of the viral ribonucleoprotein. The latest advances made for these diverse pharmacological targets have yielded agents in advanced (i.e., favipiravir and VX-787) or early clinical testing, besides several experimental inhibitors in various stages of development, which are all covered here.\",\"In this Phase IIIb study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the oral nucleotide analogue inhibitor sofosbuvir plus ribavirin, with special attention given to viral resistance, in Russian patients with HCV genotype-1 or -3.\",\"Hepatitis E virus (HEV), an important agent of viral hepatitis worldwide, can cause severe courses of infection in pregnant women and immunosuppressed patients. To date, HEV infections can only be treated with ribavirin (RBV). Major drawbacks of this therapy are that RBV is not approved for administration to pregnant women and that the virus can acquire mutations, which render the intra-host population less sensitive or even resistant to RBV. One of the proposed modes of action of RBV is a direct mutagenic effect on viral genomes, inducing mismatches and subsequent nucleotide substitutions. These transition events can drive the already error-prone viral replication beyond an error threshold, causing viral population extinction. In contrast, the expanded heterogeneous viral population can facilitate selection of mutant viruses with enhanced replication fitness. Emergence of these mutant viruses can lead to therapeutic failure. Consequently, the onset of RBV treatment in chronically HEV-infected individuals can result in two divergent outcomes: viral extinction versus selection of fitness-enhanced viruses. Following an overview of RNA viruses treated with RBV in clinics and a summary of the different antiviral modes of action of this drug, we focus on the mutagenic effect of RBV on HEV intrahost populations, and how HEV is able to overcome lethal mutagenesis.\",\"The prevalence of anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV)antibodies is higher in hemodialysis patients than in the general population, and several studies have reported poor vital prognosis in HCV-infected dialysis patients because infection with HCV is not only the cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, but also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although sustained virologic response (SVR) is achievable with interferon and ribavirin in dialysis patients, SVR rates are lower, and the use of ribavirin is challenging because of the risk of hemolytic anemia. Recently, interferon-ribavirin free direct acting antivirals (DAAs) treatment has shown strong efficacy and fewer adverse events for chronic HCV infection patients without using dialysis, but there are few reports about DAAs for such patients. Thus, we conducted a study to examine the effect and safety of daclatasvir and asunaprevir in chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1b-infected hemodialysis patients. We treated 10 patients: seven males and three females. Before treatment, we detected resistance-associated variants on the NS5A region, which is the L31M site variant, in two patients. Although two patients showed resistance-associated variant, all the patients showed quick disappearance of HCV RNA in the serum and achieved a SVR12. During this therapy, no patients displayed abnormal liver function during treatment. Two patients experienced diarrhea and another one patient complained of nausea soon after treatment but these were relieved by symptomatic therapy. We report good results of treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1b -infected patients on hemodialysis with all oral DAAs (daclatasvir and asunaprevir).\",\"Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) have potent anti-HCV effects but may provoke resistance-associated variants (RAVs). In this study, we assessed the characteristics of these RAVs and explored efficacious anti-HCV reagents using recombinant HCV with NS5A from a genotype 1b strain. We replaced the NS5A of JFH1 with that of Con1 (JFH1/5ACon1) and introduced known NS5A inhibitor resistance mutations (L31M, L31V, L31I and Y93H) individually or in combination. Susceptibilities against anti-HCV reagents were also investigated. RAVs with Y93H exhibited high extracellular core antigen levels and infectivity titers. Variants with any single mutation showed mild to moderate resistance against NS5A inhibitors, whereas variants with double mutations at both L31 and Y93 showed severe resistance. The variants with mutations exhibited similar levels of susceptibility to interferon (IFN)-\\u03b1, IFN-\\u03bb1, IFN-\\u03bb3 and Ribavirin. Variants with the Y93H mutation were more sensitive to protease inhibitors compared with JFH1/5ACon1. In conclusion, the in vitro analysis indicated that the Y93H mutation enhanced infectious virus production, suggesting advantages in the propagation of RAVs with this mutation. However, these RAVs were susceptible to protease inhibitors. Thus, a therapeutic regimen that includes these reagents is a promising means to eradicate these RAVs.\",\"Simeprevir is a hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitor. Hepatitis C virus baseline NS3/4A polymorphisms and emerging mutations were characterized in treatment-na\\u0457ve and treatment-experienced genotype 4-infected patients treated with simeprevir+peginterferon/ribavirin in the RESTORE study. Population sequencing of the NS3/4A region was performed and in vitro simeprevir activity against site-directed mutants or chimeric replicons with patient-derived NS3 protease sequences was assessed in a transient replicon assay. Simeprevir remained active against most (83/91 [91%]) baseline isolates tested in the chimeric replicon assay. Eight baseline isolates reduced simeprevir activity; these carried I132L or D168E substitutions reducing simeprevir median activity by 4.6- and 39-fold, respectively. Six of these eight isolates were from patients achieving sustained virologic response. Baseline NS3 Q80K polymorphism was not observed in the genotype 4-infected patients. Of the 107 simeprevir-treated patients, 37 did not achieve sustained virologic response for any reason. Of the 32 patients who failed treatment and had sequencing information, 28 (88%) had emerging mutations at NS3 positions 80, 122, 155, 156 and/or 168 at time of failure, similar to those in genotype 1. Emerging mutations were mainly D168V and D168E alone or combined with mutations at position 80. In general, isolates obtained at time of failure displayed high-level in vitro resistance to simeprevir (fold change \\u226550) in a chimeric replicon assay with a median simeprevir fold change value of 440, consistent with observed mutations. In conclusion, emerging mutations in genotype 4 patients failing simeprevir+peginterferon/ribavirin treatment were similar to those in genotype 1 and conferred high-level resistance to simeprevir.\",\"Within HIV-positive men having sex with men, the epidemic of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is ongoing. Transmission of resistant variants of HCV after failure of treatment with directly acting antivirals (DAA) could be a major threat to the effectivity of therapy. We determined whether HCV-resistant variants to DAAs were prevalent amongst patients with an acute HCV infection diagnosed in 2013 and 2014 in the Netherlands.\",\"Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) is the first all-oral ribavirin-free treatment approved for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6, offering a safe and highly efficacious treatment option. Large studies evaluating real-world outcomes of this regimen are lacking. We aim to evaluate real-world treatment outcomes for HCV genotype 6. A retrospective cohort study evaluated 65 adults (age \\u226518) with chronic HCV genotype 6 treated with SOF/LDV without ribavirin at a community gastroenterology clinic in the United States from November 2014 to May 2016. Rates of undetectable virus at week 4 on treatment, at end of treatment (EOT) and SVR12 were stratified by the presence of cirrhosis and prior treatment (treatment na\\u00efve vs treatment experienced). Among 65 patients with chronic HCV genotype 6 treated with SOF/LDV (52.3% male, mean age 66.3 years [SD 9.7], 41.5% cirrhosis and 15.4% treatment experienced), 97.3% had undetectable virus at week 4 on treatment, 96.9% had undetectable virus at EOT and 95.3% achieved SVR12. SVR12 was 100% in females vs 91.2% in males, P=.096, and 92.3% in patients with cirrhosis vs 97.4% in those without cirrhosis, P=.347. Resistance testing of treatment failures was attempted but unsuccessful due to lack of conforming primers to define the possible resistance mutations. Among the largest U.S. community-based real-world cohort of Asian chronic HCV genotype 6 patients treated with all-oral SOF/LDV without ribavirin, SVR12 was similar to SVR12 reported in clinical trials, confirming the safety and effectiveness of this regimen and validating current HCV genotype 6 treatment guideline recommendations.\",\"To gather data on the antiviral efficacy and safety of second generation direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatment with respect to sustained virological response (SVR) 12 wk after conclusion of treatment, and to determine predictors of SVR12 in this setting.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is unique among RNA viruses in its ability to establish chronic infection in the majority of exposed adults. HCV persists in the liver despite interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) induction; robust induction actually predicts treatment failure and viral persistence. It is unclear which forms of HCV RNA are associated with ISG induction and IFN resistance during natural infections. To thoroughly delineate HCV RNA populations, we developed conditions that fully separate the strands of long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and allow the released RNAs to be quantified in reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction assays. These methods revealed that dsRNA, a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), comprised 52% (standard deviation, 28%) of the HCV RNA in the livers of patients with chronic infection. HCV dsRNA was proportionally higher in patients with the unfavorable IL28B TT (rs12979860) genotype. Higher ratios of HCV double-stranded to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) correlated positively with ISG induction. In Huh-7.5 cells, IFN treatment increased the total amount of HCV dsRNA through a process that required de novo viral RNA synthesis and shifted the ratio of viral dsRNA/ssRNA in favor of dsRNA. This shift was blocked by ribavirin (RBV), an antiviral drug that reduces relapse in HCV patients. Northern blotting established that HCV dsRNA contained genome-length minus strands.\",\"With the latest all-oral interferon- and ribavirin-free regimens based on direct acting antivirals against the hepatitis C virus (HCV), sustained virological response rates of >90% are achieved, which is equivalent to cure. This has become possible for all genotypes and all subgroups of patients, including many of the most difficult-to-treat populations so far. Since a prophylactic HCV vaccine is not yet available, control of HCV infection will for the time being have to rely on the use of effective and safe antiviral treatments as well as their accessibility and affordability. Different approaches may apply to different parts of the world, eradication of HCV representing a major long-term goal. Whether hepatitis C becomes the first chronic viral infection to be eradicated without a prophylactic vaccine remains to be shown. Here, we briefly summarize advances in the molecular virology of hepatitis C, highlight lessons of biological relevance that were learned through the study of HCV, and its translational and clinical implications. We have also listed selected unsolved challenges, emphasizing that HCV is a unique model and that advances in this direction may yield knowledge of broad biological significance, novel technologies and insights into related important human pathogens.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is considered a major public health problem, with 200 million people infected worldwide. The treatment for HCV chronic infection with pegylated interferon alpha plus ribavirin inhibitors is unspecific; consequently, the treatment is effective in only 50% of patients infected. This has prompted the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) that target virus proteins. These DAA have demonstrated a potent effect in vitro and in vivo; however, virus mutations associated with the development of resistance have been described.\",\"The use of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) to treat chronic hepatitis C has resulted in a significant increase in rates of sustained viral response (around 90%-95%) as compared with the standard treatment of peginterferon/ribavirin. Despite this, however, the rates of therapeutic failure in daily clinical practice range from 10%-15%. Most of these cases are due to the presence of resistant viral variants, resulting from mutations produced by substitutions of amino acids in the viral target protein that reduce viral sensitivity to DAAs, thus limiting the efficacy of these drugs. The high genetic diversity of hepatitis C virus has resulted in the existence of resistance-associated variants (RAVs), sometimes even before starting treatment with DAAs, though generally at low levels. These pre-existing RAVs do not appear to impact on the sustained viral response, whereas those that appear after DAA therapy could well be determinant in virological failure with future treatments. As well as the presence of RAVs, virological failure to treatment with DAAs is generally associated with other factors related with a poor response, such as the degree of fibrosis, the response to previous therapy, the viral load or the viral genotype. Nonetheless, viral breakthrough and relapse can still occur in the absence of detectable RAVs and after the use of highly effective DAAs, so that the true clinical impact of the presence of RAVs in therapeutic failure remains to be determined.\",\"During 2011 and 2013, 155 Hungarian hepatitis C genotype 1 infected patients, mostly with advanced liver fibrosis, who did not respond to prior peginterferon + ribavirin dual therapy, started boceprevir based triple therapy in an early access program.\",\"The resistance profile of anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) agents used in combination is important to guide optimal treatment regimens. We evaluated baseline and treatment-emergent NS3/4A and NS5B amino-acid variants among HCV genotype (GT)-1a and -1b-infected patients treated with faldaprevir (HCV protease inhibitor), deleobuvir (HCV polymerase non-nucleoside inhibitor), and ribavirin in multiple clinical studies.\",\"Clinical trials of all-oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection reported high response rates in HCV/HIV coinfection, similar to those obtained in HCV monoinfection.

HCV is a leading cause of chronic liver diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current treatment options in developing countries involve pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin as dual therapy or in combination with one or more direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA). The emergence of resistance-associated variants (RAVs) after treatment reveals the great variability of this virus leading to a great difficulty in developing effective antiviral strategies. Baseline RAVs detected in DAA treatment-na\\u00efve HCV-infected patients could be of great importance for clinical management and outcome prediction. Although the frequency of naturally occurring HCV NS3 protease inhibitor mutations has been addressed in many countries, there are only a few reports on their prevalence in South America. In this study, we investigated the presence of RAVs in the HCV NS3 serine protease region by analysing a cohort of Uruguayan patients with chronic hepatitis C who had not been treated with any DAAs and compare them with the results found for other South American countries. The results of these studies revealed that naturally occurring mutations conferring resistance to NS3 inhibitors exist in a substantial proportion of Uruguayan treatment-na\\u00efve patients infected with HCV genotype 1 enrolled in these studies. The identification of these baseline RAVs could be of great importance for patients' management and outcome prediction in developing countries.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV), the major etiologic agent of \\\"non-A, non-B hepatitis\\\" was discovered 26 years ago. Even before its discovery, interferon-\\u03b1 (IFN) was already being used for treatment of this infection. The next two decades saw a series of incremental improvements of the IFN therapies by extending the duration of therapy, using IFN in combination with oral ribavirin, using pegylated IFN with ribavirin, and most recently adding oral compounds that inhibit the HCV replication (directly acting antivirals - DAAs) to that regimen. DAAs target multiple steps in the HCV life cycle and are now used in combination to treat HCV infection without the need of IFN. These IFN-free, oral DAAs regimens are highly efficacious, have minimal toxicity and are given for short duration. Approved DAAs can cure more then 90% of persons with chronic HCV infection, thereby reducing the risk of death from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, these drugs are very expensive, and currently their exorbitant cost significantly restricts the access to this therapy for many HCV infected patients.\",\"Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV), both cause serious chronic infections leading to fatal liver diseases. The prototype therapy for both HBV and HCV was based on IFN-\\u03b1 with or without ribavirin. The advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) for both HBV and HCV has remarkably improved the standard of treatment for both infections. While HCV can be eliminated following combination DAA therapy, HBV persists even after treatment, requiring life-long therapy with DAAs. Treatment with DAAs is also associated with high cost, the development of resistance and side effects. There is ample published evidence that both HBV and HCV can be eliminated from infected host cells through non-cytolytic immune mechanisms. We need to identify the mechanisms behind this successful elimination of replicating viruses and develop them into novel immunotherapeutic regimens. Moreover, a synergy of, chemo- and immuno-therapeutic strategies will be necessary to eradicate HBV or HCV from a host.\",\"Interleukin-23 (IL-23) and its downstream factor IL-17 are the key cytokines involved in immune and inflammatory response in chronic liver diseases. This study aimed to investigate the role and molecular mechanisms of the IL-23/Th17 axis in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and the efficacy of IL-23/Th17 modulation in response to anti-HCV therapy. Sixty-six HCV-infected patients and 20 healthy controls were enrolled. The patients received PegIFNa-2a and ribavirin therapy for at least 48 weeks. The plasma level of IL-23 and the number of IL-17A-, IFN-\\u03b3-, and IL-21-producing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at baseline and 12, 24, and 48 weeks following treatment were determined. The mRNA level of Th17 immune-associated molecules in PBMCs was evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) following treatment with IL-23 agonist or antagonist. Our data showed that, compared to healthy controls, HCV-infected patients had an increased plasma level of IL-23 and increased frequencies of IL-17A- and IFN-\\u03b3-producing PBMCs, whereas the HCV patients exhibited a reduced number of IL-21-producing PBMCs. However, the baseline frequencies of IL-21-producing PBMCs were markedly higher in HCV patients who achieved rapid virological response (RVR) than those without RVR. Additionally, the mRNA expressions of IL-21, IFN-\\u03b3, myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA), and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) were significantly upregulated in PBMCs, while FoxP3 expression was suppressed by IL-23 agonist. Thus, the IL-23/Th17 axis plays an important role in development of chronic HCV infection and antiviral response. IL-23 may enhance the antiviral activity of interferon-based therapy by modulating the expression of Th17 cells-associated molecules in HCV-infected patients.\",\"Treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection is most urgent in patients with severe liver fibrosis and cirrhosis because of the high risk of decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and consecutively death. The development and approval of several direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAA) in the past years has revolutionized antiviral therapy especially for patients with liver cirrhosis.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem at a global level, causing an enormous burden of hepatic and extra-hepatic morbidity and mortality. Treatment of chronic HCV (CHC) has been revolutionized in the last few years by the introduction of highly effective and well tolerated direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) able to achieve >90% rates of sustained virological response (SVR) in many groups of patients, including those previously excluded from interferon-based regimens. For such reason interferon-free regimens are now the treatments of choice for all patients. Successful anti-HCV treatment can stop liver disease progression and can solve the HCV-related extra hepatic manifestations, eventually reducing both liver-related and overall mortality. Together with the rapidly accumulating data about the evolution of treatment landscape, different guidelines from national and international Liver Scientific Societies have been published until today. However, these recommendations may not be applied worldwide as, due to high treatment costs, most of them identify as priority groups only patients with advanced liver disease. Moreover some types of patients pose clinical management problems for which even the guidelines do not always provide useful answers. With the aim of treatment optimization by filling some of the gaps of the current guidelines and addressing the remaining unmet needs in practice, a group of Italian experts, experienced on treatment of HCV infection, met in Stresa in February 2016.

It shows potent pangenotypic activity and moderately high genetic barrier to resistance improving the sustained virological response (SVR) rates. In COMMAND phase 2 trials, daclatasvir demonstrated high SVR rates in HCV genotype 1-4 chronically infected patients treated with peginterferon-a (pegIFN\\u03b1) plus ribavirin (RBV). Furthermore, it produced even higher response rates in all-oral combination with sofosbuvir, an interferon-free regimen, with or without ribavirin, in patients with advanced liver disease, HCV/HIV coinfection, liver transplantation in ALLY studies and other real-world studies. This narrative review provides information on the pharmacological properties, role, efficacy and safety of daclatasvir-containing regimens in chronic hepatitis C patients. Daclatasvir administered once-daily in combination with sofosbuvir is an effective 12-week treatment in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C and is generally safe and well tolerated.\",\"Therapies for hepatitis C (HCV) are evolving rapidly with the advent of novel direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs).

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of therapy with the nonstructural (NS) 5A inhibitor, ledipasvir, combined with the NS5B polymerase inhibitor, sofosbuvir, in patients with HCV genotype 4. In this phase 2, open-label study, 44 patients (22 treatment na\\u00efve and 22 treatment experienced) received a fixed-dose combination tablet of 90 mg of ledipasvir and 400 mg of sofosbuvir orally once-daily for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with HCV RNA <15 IU/mL 12 weeks after stopping therapy (SVR12). Among study participants, HCV genotype 4 subtypes were well represented (4a, n = 25; 4d, n = 10; other subtypes, n = 9). Ten patients (23%) had compensated cirrhosis. Of the 22 treatment-experienced patients, 21 (95%) had a non-CC IL-28B genotype. All 44 patients completed the full 12 weeks of dosing. The SVR12 rate was 93% (41 of 44; 95% confidence interval, 81-99). SVR12 rates were similar between treatment-na\\u00efve (95%; 21 of 22) and treatment-experienced (91%; 20 of 22) patients.

Emergence of transmissible resistant variants and time-dependent effectiveness are the major challenges for the currently approved antivirals, M2 ion channel blockers and neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors. Favipiravir that inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of multiple RNA viruses is approved in Japan against influenza strains resistant to available antivirals. With expanded knowledge on viral nucleoprotein (NP) and polymerase structures, novel small molecule inhibitors targeting NP oligomer formation, PA endonuclease domain, and the PB2 cap-binding domain are being developed. Combination therapy with different antiviral compounds or with host immune response modulators may further benefit clinical outcomes.\",\"While addition of the first-approved protease inhibitors (PIs), telaprevir and boceprevir, to pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy significantly increased sustained virologic response (SVR) rates, PI-based triple therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was prone to the emergence of resistant viral variants. Meanwhile, multiple direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) targeting either the HCV NS3/4A protease, NS5A or NS5B polymerase have been approved and these have varying potencies and distinct propensities to provoke resistance. The pre-clinical in vivo assessment of drug efficacy and resistant variant emergence underwent a great evolution over the last decade. This field had long been hampered by the lack of suitable small animal models that robustly support the entire HCV life cycle. In particular, chimeric mice with humanized livers (humanized mice) and chimpanzees have been instrumental for studying HCV inhibitors and the evolution of drug resistance. In this review, we present the different in vivo HCV infection models and discuss their applicability to assess HCV therapy response and emergence of resistant variants.\",\"Favipiravir, a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, has recently been approved in Japan for influenza pandemic preparedness. Here, we conducted a cell-based screening system to evaluate the susceptibility of influenza viruses to favipiravir. In this assay, the antiviral activity of favipiravir is determined by inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect, which can be measured by using a colorimetric cell proliferation assay. To demonstrate the robustness of the assay, we compared the favipiravir susceptibilities of neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor-resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), A(H7N9) and B viruses and their sensitive counterparts. No significant differences in the favipiravir susceptibilities were found between NA inhibitor-resistant and sensitive viruses. We, then, examined the antiviral susceptibility of 57 pairs of influenza viruses isolated from patients pre- and post-administration of favipiravir in phase 3 clinical trials. We found that there were no viruses with statistically significant reduced susceptibility to favipiravir or NA inhibitors, although two of 20 paired A(H1N1)pdm09, one of 17 paired A(H3N2) and one of 20 paired B viruses possessed amino acid substitutions in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunits, PB1, PB2 and PA, after favipiravir administration. This is the first report on the antiviral susceptibility of influenza viruses isolated from patients after favipiravir treatment.\",\"The hepatitis C virus (HCV), of the family flaviviridae, is one of the major causes of chronic liver diseases. Until the year 2012, HCV infections were treated using PEG-interferon and ribavirin combinations, which have a low cure rate and severe side effects. Currently, many direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are available, e.g. protease inhibitors, NS5A and polymerase inhibitors. These drugs have proven to be efficient in interferon-free treatment combinations and capable of enhancing the cure rate to above 90 %. Unlike PEG-interferon and ribavirin combinations, DAAs select for resistance in HCV. The R155K mutation in the HCV was found to resist all the currently available protease inhibitors. Here, we studied biophysical parameters like pocket (cavity) geometries and stabilizing residues of HCV 1a NS3/4A protease in wild type and mutants. We also studied HCV 1a NS3/4A protease's catalytic residues: their accessibility, energy, flexibility and binding to Phase II oral protease inhibitor vedroprevir (GS-9451), and compared these parameters between wild type and mutant(s). All these studies were performed using various bioinformatics tools (e.g. Swiss-PdbViewer and Schr\\u00f6dinger's Maestro) and web servers (e.g. DoGSiteScorer, SRide, ASA-View, WHAT IF, elN\\u00e9mo, CABS-flex, PatchDock and PLIP). From our study, we found that introduction of R155K, A156T or D168A mutation to wild-type NS3/4A protease increases the pocket's volume, surface (in the R155K mutant, surface decreases), lipo surface and depth and decreases the number of stabilizing residues. Additionally, differences in catalytic residues' solvent accessibility, energy, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and flexibility between wild type and mutants might explain changes in the protease activity and the resistance to protease inhibitors.\",\"To address the therapeutic efficacy of various treatment regimens in genotype 3 selecting randomized clinical trials and prospective National Cohort Studies.\",\"We evaluated the effects of baseline hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A, NS5B, and NS3 resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) on response to the combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, with or without ribavirin, in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection.\",\"Grazoprevir (GZR) is a second-generation hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitor. The aim of this study was to evaluate GZR plus ribavirin (RBV) in patients with HCV GT1 infection. Noncirrhotic, IL28B CC patients with HCV genotype 1 infection were randomized to GZR 100 mg once daily and RBV for 12 or 24 weeks. Patients in the 12-week arm with detectable HCV RNA at treatment week 4 (TW4) had treatment extended to 24 weeks (response-guided therapy, RGT). The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR12) at follow-up week 12 (HCV RNA <25 IU/mL) in the per-protocol (PP) population (excluding patients with important protocol deviations). Twenty-six patients were randomized and 22 were included in the PP population. SVR12 was 58.3% (7 of 12) and 90% (9 of 10) in the RGT and 24-week arms, respectively. Seven PP patients had virologic failure, including one patient in the 24-week arm who relapsed after follow-up week 12. All three breakthrough patients had wild-type (WT) virus at baseline and developed breakthrough at TW6 or TW12 with Y56H, A156T and D168A/N mutations. Of the five relapse patients, four had WT at baseline (at relapse three had WT and one had V55A and D168A), and one had S122A/T at baseline and S122T at relapse. There were no serious adverse events (AEs), discontinuations due to AEs or grade 3/4 elevations in total and/or direct bilirubin. Grazoprevir plus RBV was associated with a rapid and sustained suppression of HCV RNA. These results support further evaluation of grazoprevir-based regimens (NCT01716156; protocol P039).\",\"Pegylated interferon and ribavirin plus simeprevir therapy (simeprevir-based triple therapy) has been recently introduced, providing excellent results for nontransplant patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, there are limited data available on its effect on liver transplant recipients. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of simeprevir-based triple therapy in liver transplant recipients. We treated 9 liver transplant recipients for genotype 1b HCV reinfection with simeprevir-based triple therapy. The efficacy and adverse effects were evaluated until 24 weeks after therapy. All recipients continued immunosuppressive therapy at the same dose as that before therapy induction. Seven of the 9 recipients (77.8%) achieved sustained virological response at 24 weeks. Two recipients (22.2%) experienced viral breakthrough (BT) at 12 and 16 weeks; NS3 HCV mutations conferring resistance to simeprevir were detected in both these patients after BT. Anemia was the most common adverse effect, requiring ribavirin dose reduction and blood transfusion. However, all recipients, except those with BT, completed the 24-week therapy. No recipient experienced cellular rejection during therapy. In conclusion, simeprevir-based triple therapy exhibited high efficacy and tolerability in liver transplant recipients with genotype 1b HCV reinfection.\",\"Standard of care for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in India is peginterferon and ribavirin (RBV). The response to treatment in real life stetting is unclear. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the demographic profile and assess the virological response and predictors of response in CHC patients.\",\"We assessed the efficacy and safety of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 24 weeks in 9 human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients who relapsed after receiving 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. Eight of 9 (89%) achieved sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment. One patient relapsed at posttreatment week 4. These results suggest an effective salvage therapy for patients for whom direct-acting antiviral treatment has failed.\",\"Current anti-influenza therapy depends on administering drugs soon after infection, which is often impractical. We assessed whether combinations of oseltamivir (a neuraminidase inhibitor) and T-705 (a nonspecific inhibitor of viral polymerases) could extend the window for treating lethal infection with highly pathogenic A(H5N1) influenza virus in mice. Combination therapy protected 100% of mice, even when delayed until 96 h postinoculation. Compared to animals receiving monotherapy, mice receiving combination therapy had reduced viral loads and restricted viral spread in lung tissues, limited lung damage, and decreased inflammatory cytokine production. Next-generation sequencing showed that virus populations in T-705-treated mice had greater genetic variability, with more frequent transversion events, than did populations in control and oseltamivir-treated mice, but no substitutions associated with resistance to oseltamivir or T-705 were detected. Thus, combination therapy extended the treatment window for A(H5N1) influenza infection in mice and should be considered for evaluation in a clinical setting.\",\"High rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) has been achieved in Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT)1 and GT2 infection treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) \\u00b1ribavirin (RBV) and SOF+RBV, respectively. We evaluated the effect of baseline HCV NS5A and NS5B resistance-associated variants (RAVs) on treatment outcome and characterized variants at virologic failure. Baseline deep sequencing for NS5A and NS5B genes was performed for all GT1 patients. Deep sequencing of NS5A (GT1 only) and NS5B (GT1 and GT2) was performed for patients who failed treatment or discontinued early with detectable HCV RNA (i.e., >25 IU/mL). In patients with HCV GT1 infection, 22.3% (GT1a: 2/11; GT1b: 74/330) had \\u22651 baseline NS5A RAV. The most frequent NS5A RAVs in GT1b were Y93H (17.9%, 59/330) and L31M (2.4%, 8/330). Despite the presence of NS5A RAVs at baseline, 100% and 97% of patients achieved SVR12, compared with 100% and 99% for those with no NS5A RAVs with LDV/SOF and LDV/SOF+RBV, respectively. All patients with NS5B RAVs at baseline achieved SVR12. Of the 153 patients with GT2 infection (GT2a 60.1%, GT2b 39.9%), 3.3% (5/153) experienced viral relapse. No S282T or other NS5B RAVs were detected at baseline or relapse; no change in susceptibility to SOF or RBV was observed at relapse. In conclusion, LDV/SOF and SOF+RBV demonstrate a high barrier to resistance in Japanese patients with HCV GT1 and GT2 infection. The presence of baseline NS5A RAVs did not impact treatment outcome in GT1 Japanese patients treated with LDV/SOF for 12 weeks.\",\"Background. The pre-existence of minority hepatitis C virus (HCV) variants and their impact on treatment outcome, as well as the persistence of emerging resistant variants posttreatment in patients failing treatment with simeprevir/peginterferon/ribavirin (SMV/PR), were assessed by deep sequencing (DS). Methods. Population sequencing (PS) and Illumina DS were performed on HCV genotype 1 isolates from patients treated with SMV/PR in Phase 2b (PILLAR [NCT00882908] and ASPIRE [NCT00980330]) and Phase 3 (QUEST-1 [NCT01289782], QUEST-2 [NCT01290679], and PROMISE [NCT01281839]) trials. Results. Minority polymorphisms (ie, detected pretreatment by DS only) reducing SMV activity in vitro were uncommon (3.6%, 19 of 534 patients). These SMV-resistant minority polymorphisms were detected in similar proportions of patients achieving (3.7%) and not achieving (3.3%) sustained virologic response with SMV/PR and generally did not emerge as major variants at time of failure. SMV-resistant variants emerging at time of failure were no longer detected at end of study in 69.3% and 52.0% of the patients by PS and DS, respectively. Conclusions. Minority polymorphisms did not impact outcome of SMV/PR treatment. The majority of emerging variants that became undetectable at end of study by PS were also undetectable by DS. These results suggest no added value of DS for clinical usage of SMV.\",\"Ribavirin monotherapy is the preferred treatment for chronic hepatitis E, although occasional treatment failure occurs. We present a patient with chronic hepatitis E experiencing ribavirin treatment failure with a completely resistant phenotype. We aimed to identify viral mutations associated with treatment failure and explore the underlying mechanisms.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become a curable disease. Sustained virologic response rates above 90% have been achieved with recommended direct-acting antiviral (DAA) combinations in most registration trials. However, outcomes in real-world patients are lower. In patients experiencing DAA failure, resistance-associated variants (RAVs) are almost universally selected. At this time it is unclear when and how to re-treat hepatitis C in patients with prior DAA failure.\",\"The treatment of HCV infection has evolved at an extremely rapid pace over the past few years. The development of direct-acting antiviral agents, which potently inhibit different stages in the viral life cycle, has led to the replacement of interferon with well-tolerated oral therapies with cure rates of >90% in most patient populations. Understanding the mechanisms of action of the various agents as well as related issues, including the molecular basis for resistance, helps to guide drug development and clinical use. In this Review, we provide a mechanistic description of NS3/4A protease inhibitors, nucleotide and non-nucleotide inhibitors of the NS5B viral polymerase and inhibitors of the NS5A protein, followed by a summary of clinical data from studies of each drug class alone and in combination. Remaining challenges in drug development efforts are also discussed.\",\"We previously characterized a foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) with three amino acid replacements in its polymerase (3D) that conferred resistance to the mutagenic nucleoside analogue ribavirin. Here we show that passage of this mutant in the presence of high ribavirin concentrations resulted in selection of viruses with the additional replacement I248T in 2C. This 2C substitution alone (even in the absence of replacements in 3D) increased FMDV fitness mainly in the presence of ribavirin, prevented an incorporation bias in favor of A and U associated with ribavirin mutagenesis, and conferred the ATPase activity of 2C decreased sensitivity to ribavirin-triphosphate. Since in previous studies we described that 2C with I248T was selected under different selective pressures, this replacement qualifies as a joker substitution in FMDV evolution. The results have identified a role of 2C in nucleotide incorporation, and have unveiled a new polymerase-independent mechanism of virus escape to lethal mutagenesis.\",\"Real-life effectiveness data of new hepatitis C direct-acting antivirals are now required. The present study aims to assess the rate of sustained viral response (SVR) and virological failure (VF) in patients infected with chronic HCV treated with sofosbuvir (SOF)-based regimens in routine medical practice.\",\"A series of 1,6-bis[(benzyloxy)methyl]uracil derivatives combining structural features of both diphenyl ether and pyridone types of NNRTIs were synthesized. Target compounds were found to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase at micro- and submicromolar levels of concentrations and exhibited anti-HIV-1 activity in MT-4 cell culture, demonstrating resistance profile similar to first generation NNRTIs. The synthesized compounds also showed profound activity against influenza virus (H1N1) in MDCK cell culture without detectable cytotoxicity. The lead compound of this assay appeared to exceed rimantadine, amantadine, ribavirin and oseltamivir carboxylate in activity. The mechanism of action of 1,6-bis[(benzyloxy)methyl]uracils against influenza virus is currently under investigation.\",\"Egypt has the highest prevalence of a difficult to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), genotype 4. Pretreatment factors could guide individualization of therapy which aids in treatment optimization and interleukin IL28B gene polymorphism has been shown to closely relate to HCV treatment response. Polymorphisms in genes encoding inhibitors of T-cell response, which have role in disease progression as Programmed Cell Death 1 (PD-1), and Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes Antigen-4 (CTLA-4), could be candidate markers predicting treatment response.\",\"The burden of HCV cirrhosis is high and projected to increase significantly over the next decade. While interferon therapy is problematic in HCV cirrhosis, the era of direct-acting anti-viral (DAA) therapy provides effective treatment for patients with cirrhosis.\",\"Long lasting hepatocytes damage related to HCV infection stimulates liver fibrosis resulting in cirrhosis, hepatic failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Until 2011 the only therapeutic option was 24-48 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin (RBV) with efficacy of 40-70%. New generation of direct-acting antivirals (DAA), available from 2014, can be combined and improve efficacy above 90% with 12 weeks of treatment.\",\"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b is known to exhibit treatment resistance with respect to interferon (IFN) therapy. Substitution of amino acids 70 and 91 in the core region of the 1b genotype is a significant predictor of liver carcinogenesis and poor response to pegylated-IFN-\\u03b1 and ribavirin therapy. However, the molecular mechanism has not yet been clearly elucidated because of limitations of the HCV genotype 1b infectious model. Recently, the TPF1-M170T HCV genotype 1b cell culture system was established, in which the clone successfully replicates and infects Huh-7-derived Huh7-ALS32.50 cells. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare IFN resistance in various HCV clones using this system.\",\"To clarify the role of virus resistance in the efficiency of antiviral therapy with protease inhibitors (PIs) chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients, with moderate sensitivity to interferon-\\u03b1.\",\"To evaluate daclatasvir vs telaprevir, each combined with peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV), in treatment-naive hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1-infected patients.\",\"The treatment of hepatitis C virus has changed dramatically with the rapid advent of numerous new antiviral agents, including direct-acting antivirals and agents with non-viral targets (cyclophilin inhibitors, interferon-lambda, vaccine therapy). Given the better safety profile and high antiviral potency of direct-acting antivirals, their combination in interferon-free oral regimens is becoming the standard of care for hepatitis C virus infection, tailored to individual patients according to the degree of disease progression (fibrosis), hepatitis C virus genotype and subtype, resistance profile, and prior therapeutic history. Results from clinical studies as well as preliminary real-life data regarding the combination of sofosbuvir (a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor) and daclatasvir, a first-in-class NS5A replication complex inhibitor, demonstrate that it is one of the most promising antiviral therapies, with once-daily oral dosing, a low pill burden, good tolerability, and limited drug-drug interactions, in addition to high antiviral potency, with >90% sustained virologic response rates. This combination has high pangenotypic antiviral potency regardless of the severity and patient characteristics. The combination of sofosbuvir and an NS5A inhibitor with ribavirin for 12 weeks appears to be a very good further treatment option in both cirrhotic and treatment-experienced patients whatever the stage of fibrosis.\",\"Without a vaccine, hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a global medical and socio-economic burden, predisposing about 170 million carriers worldwide to end-stage liver diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the recently developed direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have revolutionized hepatitis C treatment, most of them are unsuitable for monotherapy due to risks of resistance, thus necessitating combination with interferon (IFN)-alpha, ribavirin, or additional DAAs. More importantly, the high cost associated with the DAAs restricts their accessibility to most parts of the world. Developing novel cost-effective anti-HCV therapeutics may help expand the scope of antivirals and treatment strategies against hepatitis C. Herein, we applied an activity-based and fraction-guided analysis of extracts from the medicinal plant Phyllanthus urinaria (P. urinaria), which yielded fraction 13 (F13) as possessing the most potent inhibitory activity against early viral entry of cell-culture HCV infection. Chemical analysis (silica gel chromatography followed by ESI LC-MS plus (1)H and (13)C NMR) of F13 identified loliolide (LOD), a monoterpenoid lactone, as a novel inhibitor of HCV entry. Specifically, LOD could efficiently inactivate HCV free virus particles, abrogate viral attachment, and impede viral entry/fusion, with minimal effect on viral replication/translation, particle production, and induction of type I IFN host antiviral immune response. ELISA-based binding analysis confirmed the monoterpenoid's ability in efficiently blocking HCV particle attachment to the host cell surface. Furthermore, LOD could inhibit infection by several genotypic strains of HCV. This is the first report characterizing P. urinaria and its bioactive compound LOD as potent HCV entry inhibitors, which merit further evaluation for development as candidate antiviral agents against hepatitis C.\",\"Daclatasvir plus asunaprevir (DCV + ASV) has demonstrated potent antiviral activity in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b (GT-1b) infection in the HALLMARK DUAL trial. This post hoc analysis was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of this treatment in Asian patients.\",\"The treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has progressed markedly over the last 2 decades, with a dramatic acceleration the last 3 years. The combination of two or three direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) targeting viral proteins [NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5B nucleos(t)idic and non-nucleos(t)idic polymerase inhibitors, NS5A replication complex inhibitors], with or without ribavirin but without interferon (interferon-free regimen), for 8-24 weeks, achieved high sustained virological response (>90%), whatever fibrosis stage, genotype and subtype, baseline viral load, prior therapeutic history of the patient (na\\u00efve or experienced) and pre-existing resistance-associated variants with a fair tolerance and reduced pill burden. International guidelines recommend to ideally treat all infected patients even if a prioritization of the most severe patients (extensive fibrosis or cirrhosis, symptomatic cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis\\u2026) appears to be the best cost-effective and urgent policy. Patients with stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) have to be considered as priority patients. Updating of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes recommendations is due to start soon, but awaiting their availability, we present here an overview of recent developments in the field.\",\"Daclatasvir plus asunaprevir has demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1b infection. This study focused on evaluating daclatasvir plus asunaprevir in interferon (\\u00b1ribavirin)-ineligible or -intolerant Asian patients with genotype 1b infection from mainland China, Korea, and Taiwan.\",\"The introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) has markedly improved the sustained virological response (SVR) rates in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Currently, four classes of DAAs targeting three HCV proteins (NS3, NS5A, and NS5B) have been approved for treatment in many countries. Since drugs show advantages and disadvantages, use of a combination of two or more DAAs with different targets or addition of ribavirin in a difficult-to-treat patient shows an SVR rate of ~90% after 12 weeks of treatment or expanded treatment for 24 weeks. Various types of DAA are awaiting approval which will improve the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection. However, high costs, drug resistance and interactions between various drugs remain to be overcome. With further advances in the development of antiviral agents, it could be expected that in the near future, there will be DAAs that are affordable and cost effective, require shorter treatment duration, effective in a broad range of patients, and have less side effects and drug-drug interactions.\",\"In the phase III registration studies conducted in Japan, Japanese HCV gt1 patients administered vaniprevir 300 mg twice daily plus pegylated interferon/ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks achieved SVR24 rates of 83.7-84.5% among treatment-na\\u00efve patients, and 92.0-96.2% and 61.9% among breakthrough/relapsers or null-responders to prior interferon based therapy. As evidenced by direct sequencing, patients who did not achieve SVR24 principally failed due to treatment-emerging mutations at D168 or in a few cases R155. In this work, additional sequence analysis was conducted to address whether there were baseline polymorphisms associated with failure, evaluate the persistence of resistant virus among treatment failures, and assess for evidence of second site co-evolution with R155 or D168 mutations. To accomplish this, clonal sequencing (up to 40 clones per sample) was conducted on baseline, failure, and follow-up samples from all 38 patients among the vaniprevir treatment arms who met virologic failure criteria (37 gt1b, 1 gt1a, herein referred to as virologic failures) and baseline samples from 41 vaniprevir-treated SVR24 patients (all gt1b) selected among the three studies. SVR24 and virologic failure patients showed similar distributions of baseline polymorphisms previously associated with failure to one or more protease inhibitors. Furthermore, there was no evidence for baseline polymorphisms or a genetic signature across the NS3 protease domain specific to virologic failure patients, and which distinguishes them from baseline SVR24 sequences beyond a chance distribution. 24 of 32 virologic failures for whom baseline, failure, and follow-up samples were available showed reduced prevalence of the resistant virus first observed at the time of failure during the protocol-defined follow-up period of 24 weeks. Finally, pairwise analysis using either alignment or phylogenetic based methodologies provided no evidence for second site evolution with either the R155 or D168 mutations attributed to failure. This work supports and extends earlier findings based upon direct sequencing that attributed virologic failure to vaniprevir in the Phase III studies solely to the emergence of R155 or D168 mutations, with no apparent influence by other residues within the NS3 protease domain on treatment outcome. CLINICALTRIALS.\",\"Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease characterized by treatment resistance and high recurrence rate. Repopulation of surviving tumor cells undergoing radiotherapy is one of the most common reasons for recurrence. Our previous studies have discovered a novel mechanism for repopulation after irradiation that activation of caspase-3 in irradiated tumor cells activates PKC\\u03b4/p38 axis to transmit proliferation signals promoting repopulation of surviving tumor cells. Here we found Sox2 expression is up-regulated in irradiated pancreatic cancer cells, which played a major role in tumor cell repopulation after irradiation. Over-expression of Sox2 strongly enhanced the growth-stimulating effect of irradiated dying tumor cells on living tumor cells through a paracrine modality. Furthermore, we identified activated eIF4E, which is phosphorylated by MNK1, as a regulator of Sox2 expression after irradiation, and pharmacologic inhibition of eIF4E with CGP57380 and Ribavirin significantly weakened Sox2-mediated tumor cell repopulation. Finally, we showed the activation of caspase 3/PKC\\u03b4/p38/MNK1 signal pathway in irradiated pancreatic tumor cells. Together, we showed a novel pathway regulating Sox2 expression and Sox2 may be a promising target to reduce recurrence due to repopulation of surviving tumor cells after radiotherapy.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an important source of morbidity and mortality among haemophiliacs. Limited data are available regarding treatment intervention using direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) and theoretical concerns regarding accumulation of drug-associated resistance variants (RAVs) remain. We conducted a pilot study of treatment with telaprevir/pegylated interferon-alfa/ribavirin to evaluate treatment response and the role of lead-in DAA therapy on mutational selection of resistance variants.\",\"Therapeutic options for patients with HCV-related liver disease have increased over the last two decades. In fact, the old standard of care based on the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin did not result in satisfactory eradication rates, particularly in patients with liver cirrhosis. With the advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), higher rates of viral clearance became possible and, patients with contraindications to interferon obtained access to treatment. However, several concerns have been raised regarding first-generation DAAs, namely their high costs, and the emergence of resistant-associated variants with low susceptibility to these drugs.\",\"The African American/Black population in the United States (US) is disproportionately affected by hepatitis C virus (HCV) and has lower response rates to current treatments. This analysis evaluates the participation of African American/Blacks in North American and European HCV clinical trials. The data source for this analysis was the PubMed database. Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT) on HCV treatment with interferon 2a or 2b between January 2000 and December 2011 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria included English language and participants 18 years or older with chronic HCV. Exclusion criteria included non-randomized trials, case reports, cohort studies, ethnic specific studies, or studies not using interferon-alfa or PEG-interferon. Of the 588 trials identified, 314 (53.4%) fit inclusion criteria. The main outcome was the rate of African American/ Black participation in North American HCV clinical trials. A meta-analysis comparing the expected and observed rates was performed. Of the RCT's that met search criteria, 123 (39.2%) reported race. Clinical trials in North America were more likely to report racial data than European trials. Racial reporting increased over time. There was a statistically significant difference among the expected and observed participation of African Americans in HCV clinical trials in North America based on the prevalence of this disease within the population. The burden of HCV among African Americans in North America is not reflected in those clinical trials designed to treat HCV. Research on minority participation in clinical trials and how to increase minority participation in clinical trials is needed.\",\"The selection of resistance-associated variants (RAVs) against single agents administered to patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) necessitates that direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) targeting multiple viral proteins be developed to overcome failure resulting from emergence of resistance. The combination of grazoprevir (formerly MK-5172), an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, and elbasvir (formerly MK-8742), an NS5A inhibitor, was therefore studied in genotype 1a (GT1a) replicon cells. Both compounds were independently highly potent in GT1a wild-type replicon cells, with 90% effective concentration (EC90) values of 0.9 nM and 0.006 nM for grazoprevir and elbasvir, respectively. No cross-resistance was observed when clinically relevant NS5A and NS3 RAVs were profiled against grazoprevir and elbasvir, respectively. Kinetic analyses of HCV RNA reduction over 14 days showed that grazoprevir and elbasvir inhibited prototypic NS5A Y93H and NS3 R155K RAVs, respectively, with kinetics comparable to those for the wild-type GT1a replicon. In combination, grazoprevir and elbasvir interacted additively in GT1a replicon cells. Colony formation assays with a 10-fold multiple of the EC90 values of the grazoprevir-elbasvir inhibitor combination suppressed emergence of resistant colonies, compared to a 100-fold multiple for the independent agents. The selected resistant colonies with the combination harbored RAVs that required two or more nucleotide changes in the codons. Mutations in the cognate gene caused greater potency losses for elbasvir than for grazoprevir. Replicons bearing RAVs identified from resistant colonies showed reduced fitness for several cell lines and may contribute to the activity of the combination. These studies demonstrate that the combination of grazoprevir and elbasvir exerts a potent effect on HCV RNA replication and presents a high genetic barrier to resistance. The combination of grazoprevir and elbasvir is currently approved for chronic HCV infection.\",\"Insulin resistance is considered to be an important factor in the progression of fibrosis and the enhancement of the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for chronic hepatitis C patients. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of insulin resistance on the development of HCC by non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis C patients treated with pegylated interferon alpha-2b (PEG-IFN\\u03b12b) and ribavirin.\",\"Unlike human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a curable disease. Current direct antiviral agent (DAA) targets are focused on HCV NS3/4A protein (protease), NS5B protein (polymerase) and NS5A protein. The first generation of DAAs includes boceprevir and telaprevir, which are protease inhibitors and were approved for clinical use in 2011. The cure rate for genotype 1 patients increased from 45% to 70% when boceprevir or telaprevir was added to standard PEG-IFN/ribavirin. More effective and less toxic second generation DAAs supplanted these drugs by 2013. The second generation of DAAs includes sofosbuvir (Sovaldi), simeprevir (Olysio), and fixed combination medicines Harvoni and Viekira Pak. These drugs increase cure rates to over 90% without the need for interferon and effectively treat all HCV genotypes. With these drugs the \\\"cure HCV\\\" goal has become a reality. Concerns remain about drug resistance mutations and the high cost of these drugs. The investigation of new HCV drugs is progressing rapidly; fixed dose combination medicines in phase III clinical trials include Viekirax, asunaprevir+daclatasvir+beclabuvir, grazoprevir+elbasvir and others.\",\"In a previous study, ribavirin-resistant porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) mutants (RVRp13 and RVRp22) were selected, and their resistance against random mutation was shown in cultured cells. In the present study, these ribavirin-resistant mutants were evaluated in terms of their genetic and phenotypic stability during three pig-to-pig passages in comparison with modified live virus (MLV) (Ingelvac PRRS MLV). Pigs challenged with RVRp22 had significantly lower (P< 0.05) viral loads in sera and tissues than pigs challenged with MLV or RVRp13 at the first passage, and the attenuated replication of RVRp22 was maintained until the third passage. Viral loads in sera and tissues dramatically increased in pigs challenged with MLV or RVRp13 during the second passage. Consistently, all five sequences associated with the attenuation of virulent PRRSV in RVRp13 and MLV quickly reverted to wild-type sequences during the passages, but two attenuation sequences were maintained in RVRp22 even after the third passage. In addition, RVRp22 showed a significantly lower (P< 0.001) mutation frequency in nsp2, which is one of the most variable regions in the PRRSV genome, than MLV. Nine unique mutations were found in open reading frames (ORFs) 1a, 2, and 6 in the RVRp22 genome based on full-length sequence comparisons with RVRp13, VR2332 (the parental virus of RVRp13 and RVRp22), and MLV. Based on these results, it was concluded that RVRp22 showed attenuated replication in pigs; further, because of the high genetic stability of RVRp22, its attenuated phenotype was stable even after three sequential passages in pigs.\",\"Effective and safe antiviral treatment regimens are needed for patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and cirrhosis.\",\"The goal of this study was to identify host and viral factors affecting the response to pegylated interferon/ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b. Baseline characteristics of the patients and sequences within the p7 region were analyzed in pre-treatment serum samples from 53 individuals with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b and related to the outcome of therapy. We found a significant correlation between age and response to therapy (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the pre-treatment viral load was closely associated with the stage of liver fibrosis (p < 0.001). The presence of fewer than 4 mutations and age above 40 were significantly associated with non-response (NR) (p < 0.001). Our findings may be useful for estimating the likelihood of achieving a sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients who are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1b.\",\"Patients 1 and 2 were treatment-naive women who had genotype 1b chronic hepatitis C. Both had IL-28B genotype TT, and amino acid substitutions of core 70 and 91 were both wild type. Search for the presence of resistance-associated variants (RAV) in non-structural (NS)3 and NS5A regions confirmed wild-type D168 and L31, along with Y93H, in both patients. These patients participated in a Japanese phase III clinical study of asunaprevir and daclatasvir at the age of 52 and 67 years, respectively, and were treated with the combination regimen for 24 weeks. However, both experienced post-treatment relapse, and then treated with triple combination therapy with simeprevir, pegylated interferon (IFN) and ribavirin at the age of 53 and 68 years, respectively, and achieved sustained virological response. A search for RAV prior to simeprevir treatment identified multiple resistance including D168E, Y93H and L31V in both patients. It has been demonstrated that, in many cases, a treatment failure with a combination of asunaprevir and daclatasvir results in acquisition of RAV in NS3 and NS5A regions and that drug-resistant mutants, particularly those in the NS5A region, survive for a long time. In these cases, direct-acting antivirals targeted towards the NS5A region may have a limited efficacy. The present case report is based on an idea that a regimen containing IFN with simeprevir could be a therapeutic option particularly for those who are likely to be highly sensitive and tolerable to IFN.\",\"Despite the enormous disease burden associated with dengue virus infections, a licensed antiviral drug is lacking. Here, we show that the paracetamol (acetaminophen) metabolite AM404 inhibits dengue virus replication. Moreover, we find that mutations in NS4B that were previously found to confer resistance to the antiviral compounds NITD-618 and SDM25N also render dengue virus insensitive to AM404. Our work provides further support for NS4B as a direct or indirect target for antiviral drug development.\",\"Failure to achieve sustained virological response (SVR) with hepatitis C virus (HCV) direct-acting antiviral-based regimens is commonly associated with emergence of resistance-associated variants (RAVs). To avoid cross-resistance, recent guidelines recommend that patients who have failed on nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitors should be retreated with sofosbuvir (SOF; NS5B inhibitor) combined with simeprevir (SIM; protease inhibitor [PI]); however, supporting evidence is lacking. This \\\"real-world\\\" study comprised patients who had failed to achieve SVR on previous NS5A-based therapy with daclatasvir (DCV) plus pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), with (n = 3) or without (n = 13) asunaprevir (ASV; PI). All 16 patients were retreated for 12 weeks with SOF plus SIM, without RBV. Antiviral efficacy was evaluated using the primary endpoint of SVR12 (SVR 12 weeks post-treatment); on-treatment response was also assessed. Patients (N = 16; 13 male; mean age: 54 years [range, 43-73]) were chronically infected with HCV genotype (GT) 1 (1a, n = 11; 1b, n = 3) or 4 (n = 2); they had advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis (FibroScan, 9.6-70 kPa; cirrhosis, n = 9); median baseline HCV-RNA level was 1.38 \\u00d7 10(6) IU/mL. No patient discontinued treatment because of adverse events or virological failure. All patients achieved HCV RNA below lower limit of quantification (<12 IU/mL) by end of treatment (EOT) and 10 of 16 had a rapid response (week 4). SVR12 was achieved by 14 of 16 patients; the remaining 2 relapsed by 4 weeks post-EOT (both were GT 1a infected with cirrhosis; 1 had previously failed DCV-ASV plus Peg-IFN and RBV). Presence of SIM RAVs/polymorphisms (R155K and Q80K) at study baseline did not predict retreatment failure.\",\"Approximately 130 - 150 million people have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and upwards of 500,000 deaths annually are attributed to HCV related liver disease worldwide. Pegylated interferon and ribavirin have been the mainstay of treatment for greater than 25 years until recent advent of protease inhibitors which has led to all oral HCV treatment regimens that have changed the outlook of hepatitis C treatment.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common blood-borne infection in the United States. The high morbidity and mortality due to untreated infection have prompted updated screening recommendations that now include one-time HCV screening for all patients born between 1945 and 1965, in addition to risk factor-based screening. Current guidelines recommend treatment for all patients with chronic HCV. Treatment for HCV genotype 1 has evolved dramatically since the approval of the direct-acting antivirals. The approval of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir, ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir and dasabuvir, and simeprevir with sofosbuvir has dramatically altered the treatment landscape. High sustained virologic response (SVR) rates favor treatment, yet access to care poses a challenge for patients and providers. Current and emerging data with new therapies indicate high SVR rates in treatment-na\\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients, including patients with cirrhosis and in other special populations. Additional data suggest the addition of ribavirin can decrease treatment duration without compromising SVR rates. Resistance is an increasing area of interest in HCV, with baseline mutations identified and the potential for the development of resistance-associate variants in patients undergoing treatment. Due to the rapid evolution of HCV treatment, pharmacists should address challenges and play an integral role in agent selection, dosing, drug interaction screening, adverse effect monitoring, and the coordination of treatment. Clinical application of the latest information will reduce patient risk and improve outcomes.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects 80-160 million people worldwide and is one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease. It is only a few years ago that standard treatment regimes were based on pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin. However, treatment of HCV has undergone a revolutionary change in recent years. The admission of the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor Sofosbuvir enabled an interferon-free regimen with direct antiviral agents (DAA). Meanwhile seven DAAs are available and can be applied in several combinations for 8 to 24 wk depending on HCV genotype and patient characteristics such as cirrhosis and chronic renal failure. High rates of sustained virological response (SVR) rates can be achieved with these novel drugs. Even in difficult to treat populations such as patients with liver cirrhosis, HCV-human immunodeficiency virus co-infections, after liver transplantion, or with chronic kidney disease comparable high rates of SVR can be achieved. The anticipated 2(nd) generation DAAs are strikingly effective in patients so far classified as difficult to treat including decompensated liver cirrhosis or post-transplant patients. These 2(nd) generations DAAs will have higher resistance barriers, higher antiviral effects and a pan-genotypic spectrum. This review highlights the current state of the art of antiviral treatment in hepatitis C and gives an outlook for upcoming therapies.\",\"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase NS5B is essentially required for viral replication and serves as a prominent drug target. Sofosbuvir is a prodrug of a nucleotide analog that interacts selectively with NS5B and has been approved for HCV treatment in combination with ribavirin. Although the emergence of resistance to sofosbuvir is rarely seen in the clinic, the S282T mutation was shown to decrease susceptibility to this drug. S282T was also shown to confer hypersusceptibility to ribavirin, which is of potential clinical benefit. Here we devised a biochemical approach to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Recent crystallographic data revealed a hydrogen bond between S282 and the 2'-hydroxyl of the bound nucleotide, while the adjacent G283 forms a hydrogen bond with the 2'-hydroxyl of the residue of the template that base pairs with the nucleotide substrate. We show that DNA-like modifications of the template that disrupt hydrogen bonding with G283 cause enzyme pausing with natural nucleotides. However, the specifically introduced DNA residue of the template reestablishes binding and incorporation of sofosbuvir in the context of S282T. Moreover, the DNA-like modifications of the template prevent the incorporation of ribavirin in the context of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the S282T mutant enables the binding and incorporation of ribavirin under the same conditions. Together, these findings provide strong evidence to show that susceptibility to sofosbuvir and ribavirin depends crucially on a network of interdependent hydrogen bonds that involve the adjacent residues S282 and G283 and their interactions with the incoming nucleotide and complementary template residue, respectively.\",\"Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 infection, especially those with advanced liver disease, are a challenging population in urgent need of optimally effective therapies. The combination of daclatasvir (DCV; pangenotypic nonstructural protein 5A inhibitor) and sofosbuvir (SOF; nucleotide nonstructural protein 5B inhibitor) for 12 weeks previously showed high efficacy (96%) in noncirrhotic genotype 3 infection. The phase III ALLY-3+ study (N = 50) evaluated DCV-SOF with ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-na\\u00efve (n = 13) or treatment-experienced (n = 37) genotype 3-infected patients with advanced fibrosis (n = 14) or compensated cirrhosis (n = 36). Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive open-label DCV-SOF (60 + 400 mg daily) with weight-based RBV for 12 or 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was sustained virological response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12). SVR12 (intention-to-treat) was 90% overall (45 of 50): 88% (21 of 24) in the 12-week (91% observed) and 92% (24 of 26) in the 16-week group. All patients with advanced fibrosis achieved SVR12. SVR12 in patients with cirrhosis was 86% overall (31 of 36): 83% (15 of 18) in the 12-week (88% observed) and 89% (16 of 18) in the 16-week group; for treatment-experienced patients with cirrhosis, these values were 87% (26 of 30), 88% (14 of 16; 93% observed), and 86% (12 of 14), respectively. One patient (12-week group) did not enter post-treatment follow-up (death unrelated to treatment). There were 4 relapses (2 per group) and no virological breakthroughs. The most common adverse events (AEs) were insomnia, fatigue, and headache. There were no discontinuations for AEs and no treatment-related serious AEs.\",\"About 130-170 million people, is estimated to be infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Chronic HCV infection is one of the leading causes of liver-related death and in many countries it is the primary reason for having a liver transplant. The main aim of antiviral treatment is to eradicate the virus. Until a few years ago the only treatment strategy was based on the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PEG/RBV). However, in genotypes 1 and 4 the rates of viral response did not surpass 50%, reaching up to 80% in the rest. In 2011 approval was given for the first direct acting antiviral agents (DAA), boceprevir and telaprevir, for treatment of genotype 1, in combination with traditional dual therapy. This strategy managed to increase the rates of sustained viral response (SVR) in both naive patients and in retreated patients, but with greater toxicity, interactions and cost, as well as being less safe in patients with advanced disease, in whom this treatment can trigger decompensation or even death. The recent, accelerated incorporation since 2013 of new more effective DAA, with pan-genomic properties and excellent tolerance, besides increasing the rates of SVR (even up to 100%), has also created a new scenario: shorter therapies, less toxicity and regimens free of PEG/RBV. This has enabled their almost generalised applicability in all patients. However, it should be noted that most of the scientific evidence available is based on expert opinion, case-control series, cohort studies and phase 2 and 3 trials, some with a reduced number of patients and select groups. Few data are currently available about the use of these drugs in daily clinical practice, particularly in relation to the appearance of side effects and interactions with other drugs, or their use in special populations or persons with the less common genotypes. This situation suggests the need for the generalised implementation of registries of patients receiving antiviral therapy. The main inconvenience of these new drugs is their high cost. This necessitates selection and prioritization of candidate patients to receive them, via strategies established by the various national organs, in accordance with the recommendations of scientific societies.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been shown to be linked to a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes compared with the general population or with patients with chronic hepatitis B infection and diabetes is the most common extra-hepatic manifestation of HCV. The HCV-diabetes association is due to insulin resistance (IR) that occurs early in the course of the disease even in patients without or with minimal fibrosis. The mechanisms for HCV-induced IR are only partly understood and include a direct inhibitory effect of HCV on insulin signaling pathway. IR in chronic HCV results in an increased progression rate of hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Some but not all studies found that IR reduces the response rate to interferon/ribavirin therapy. Whether IR affects the response to the new direct-acting antiviral treatments is still unknown.\",\"Before the advent of direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) ribavirin, associated to pegylated-interferon played a crucial role in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, preventing relapses and breakthroughs. In the present era of new potent DAAs, a place is still devoted to the drug. Ribavirin associated with sofosbuvir alone is efficient in the treatment of most cases of G2 infected patients. All options currently available for the last difficult-to-treat cirrhotic G3 patients contain ribavirin. Reducing treatment duration to 12 wk in G1 or G4 cirrhotic compensated patients is feasible thanks to ribavirin. Retreating patients with acquired anti NS5A resistance-associated variants using ribavirin-based strategies could be useful. The addition of ribavirin with DAAs combinations however, leads to more frequent but mild adverse events especially in cirrhotic patients. Preliminary data with interferon-free second generation DAAs combinations without ribavirin suggest that future of the drug is jeopardized even in difficult-to-treat patients: The optimization of ribavirin dosage according to an early monitoring of blood levels has been suggested to be relevant in double therapy with peginterferon or sofosbuvir but not with very potent combinations of more than two DAAs.\",\"A target-free and cell-based approach was applied to evaluate the anti-influenza properties of six newly synthesized benzoic acid derivatives. SA-2, the ethyl 4-(2-hydroxymethyl-5-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)-3-[3-(3-methylbenzoyl)-thioureido] benzoate (compound 2) was screened as a potential drug candidate. In a cytopathic effect assay, SA-2 dose dependently inhibited H1N1, H3N2 and the oseltamivir-resistant mutant H1N1-H275Y influenza viruses in both virus-infected MDCK and A549 cells, with 50% effective concentrations (EC50) in MDCK cells of 9.6, 19.2 and 19.8 \\u03bcM respectively, and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of 444.5 \\u03bcM, showing competitive antiviral activity with oseltamivir in vitro. Orally administered SA-2 effectively protected mice infected with lethal doses of H1N1 or oseltamivir-resistant strain H1N1-H275Y, conferring 70% or 50% survival at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/d, reducing body weight loss, alleviating the influenza-induced acute lung injury, and reducing lung virus titer. Mechanistic studies showed that SA-2 efficiently inhibited the activity of RNA polymerase and suppressed NP and M1 levels during viral biosynthesis by interfering with gene transcription without having an obvious influence on virus entry and release. Based on these favourable findings, SA-2, a novel anti-influenza agent, with its potent anti-influenza activity in vitro and in vivo, could be a promising antiviral for the treatment of infection of influenza A viruses, including oseltamivir-resistant mutants.\",\"Among many subtypes of influenza A viruses, influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) subtypes are currently circulating among humans (WHO report 2014-15). Therapeutically, the emergence of viral resistance to currently available drugs (adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors) has heightened alarms for developing novel drugs that could address diverse targets in the viral replication cycle in order to improve treatment outcomes. To this regard, the design and synthesis of nucleoside analog inhibitors as potential anti-influenza A agents is a very active field of research nowadays. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of hitherto unknown 6-methyl-7-substituted-7-deaza purine nucleoside analogs, and evaluated for their biological activities against influenza A virus strains, H1N1 and H3N2. From the viral inhibition assay, we identified some effective compounds, among which, compounds 5x (IC50 = 5.88 \\u03bcM and 6.95 \\u03bcM for H1N1 and H3N2, respectively) and 5z (IC50 = 3.95 \\u03bcM and 3.61 \\u03bcM for H1N1 and H3N2, respectively) demonstrated potent anti-influenza A activity. On the basis of selectivity index, we conceive that compound 5x may serve as a chemical probe of interest for further lead optimization studies with a general aim of developing novel and effective anti-influenza A virus agents.\",\"Direct-acting anti-virals (DAAs) licensed to treat chronic HCV infection have revolutionised treatment algorithms by drastically mitigating side effects while enhancing efficacy relative to interferon-based therapy.\",\"ABT-530 is a next-generation hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor with potent pangenotypic antiviral activity in vitro.

As an essential regulatory hub in cancer signalling network, many oncogenic signalling pathways appear to converge on eIF4E. Therefore, targeting eIF4E-mediated cap-dependent translation is considered a promising anticancer strategy. This paper reviews the strategies that can be used to target eIF4E, highlighting agents that target eIF4E activity at each distinct level.\",\"Intravenous drug users (IDUs) represent a highly-infected reservoir for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide, harboring some of the most elevated prevalences and majority of the epidemic in developed nations. Studies aimed at sequencing regions of the viral genome uncovered amino acid mutations, some of which have been implicated in resistance to standard of care pegylated interferon/Ribavirin double therapy. Using the nested PCR method on the Core region of HCV strains in Moroccan IDUs living in the Tangier region this study sought to identify genotype-specific amino acid mutations, followed by Phylogenetic methods in order to compare them with international strains so as to identify sequences of highest homology. Genotyping was confirmed and recombination events excluded by line-probe assay. Italy was found most homologous for genotypes 1a and 3a, Iran for genotype 1a and Egypt for genotype 4a. Amino Acid Mutation analysis revealed the following novel genotype 3a-specific mutations: N16I, L36V, T49A, P71S, T75S, and T110N. The outcome of this work describes the HCV genetic heterogeneity in high-risk intravenous drug users, and it gives clues to the global migratory flow of genotypes as they cross geographical boundaries between various IDU populations and identifies \\\"signature\\\" amino acid mutations traceable to HCV genotype 3a. Identification of key amino acid positions in the HCV Core region with higher rates of mutations paves the way for eventual clinical trials seeking to establish a link between these recurrent mutations and response to standard of care Interferon and Ribavirin antiviral therapy.

While a number of candidate drugs have shown limited efficacy in vitro and/or in non-human primate studies, differences in experimental methodologies make it difficult to compare their therapeutic effectiveness. Using an in vitro model of Ebola Zaire replication with transcription-competent virus like particles (trVLPs), requiring only level 2 biosafety containment, we compared the activities of the type I interferons (IFNs) IFN-\\u03b1 and IFN-\\u00df, a panel of viral polymerase inhibitors (lamivudine (3TC), zidovudine (AZT) tenofovir (TFV), favipiravir (FPV), the active metabolite of brincidofovir, cidofovir (CDF)), and the estrogen receptor modulator, toremifene (TOR), in inhibiting viral replication in dose-response and time course studies. We also tested 28 two- and 56 three-drug combinations against Ebola replication. IFN-\\u03b1 and IFN-\\u00df inhibited viral replication 24 hours post-infection (IC50 0.038\\u03bcM and 0.016\\u03bcM, respectively). 3TC, AZT and TFV inhibited Ebola replication when used alone (50-62%) or in combination (87%). They exhibited lower IC50 (0.98-6.2\\u03bcM) compared with FPV (36.8\\u03bcM), when administered 24 hours post-infection. Unexpectedly, CDF had a narrow therapeutic window (6.25-25\\u03bcM). When dosed >50\\u03bcM, CDF treatment enhanced viral infection. IFN-\\u00df exhibited strong synergy with 3TC (97.3% inhibition) or in triple combination with 3TC and AZT (95.8% inhibition). This study demonstrates that IFNs and viral polymerase inhibitors may have utility in EVD. We identified several 2 and 3 drug combinations with strong anti-Ebola activity, confirmed in studies using fully infectious ZEBOV, providing a rationale for testing combination therapies in animal models of lethal Ebola challenge. These studies open up new possibilities for novel therapeutic options, in particular combination therapies, which could prevent and treat Ebola infection and potentially reduce drug resistance.\",\"Most patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection who have had a previous null response (<2-log10 reduction in HCV RNA by treatment week 12) to peginterferon/ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) do not achieve a sustained virological response (SVR) when re-treated with a first-generation HCV protease inhibitor (PI) administered in combination with PegIFN/RBV. We studied the incremental benefits associated with adding mericitabine (nucleoside analog inhibitor of HCV polymerase) to PI plus PegIFN alfa-2a/RBV-based therapy in two double-blind randomized multicenter phase 2 trials (with boceprevir in DYNAMO 1, and with telaprevir in DYNAMO 2). The primary endpoint in both trials was SVR, defined as HCV RNA <25 IU/mL 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). Overall, the addition of mericitabine to PI plus PegIFN alfa-2a/RBV therapy resulted in SVR12 rates of 60-70% in DYNAMO 1 and of 71-96% in DYNAMO 2. SVR12 rates were similar in patients infected with HCV genotype 1a and 1b in both trials. The placebo control arms in both studies were stopped because of high rates of virological failure. Numerically lower relapse rates were associated with longer treatment with mericitabine (24 versus 12 weeks), telaprevir-containing regimens, and regimens that included 48 weeks of PegIFN alfa-2a/RBV therapy. No mericitabine resistance mutations were identified in any patient in either trial. The addition of mericitabine did not add to the safety burden associated with either telaprevir or boceprevir-based regimens. These studies demonstrate increased SVR rates and reduced relapse rates in difficult-to-treat patients when a nucleoside polymerase inhibitor with intermediate antiviral potency is added to regimens containing a first-generation PI.\",\"Daclatasvir is a nonstructural protein 5A inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. Asunaprevir is an NS3/4A complex inhibitor of HCV replication. The combination of daclatasvir and asunaprevir has been approved in Japan for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic HCV infection. In vitro studies have documented potent activity of these drugs, individually and in combination, against genotype 1 HCV. Results from completed and ongoing clinical studies have confirmed this potent activity in patients, with better responses noted in genotype 1b patients compared to patients with genotype 1a HCV. Response rates are also better in treatment-naive patients compared to those who are treatment-experienced; in these cases, the addition of interferon and ribavirin appears to enhance the treatment response. The combination of daclatasvir and asunaprevir is, in general, well tolerated. Daclatasvir and asunaprevir are substrates for cytochrome P450 3A4 enzymatic pathway; thus, there is a substantial potential for drug interactions.\",\"Marginal zone lymphomas have been associated with several infectious agents covering both viral and bacterial pathogens and in some cases a clear aetiological role has been established. Pathogenetic mechanisms are currently not completely understood. However, the role of chronic stimulation of the host immune response with persistent lymphocyte activation represents the most convincing explanation for lymphoproliferation. Gastric MALT lymphoma is strictly associated with Helicobacter pylori infection and various eradicating protocols, developed due to increasing antibiotic resistance, represent the first line therapy for gastric MALT. The response rate to eradication is good with 80% of response at 1 year; this finding is also noteworthy because it recapitulates cancer cured only by the antibacterial approach and it satisfies the Koch postulates of causation, establishing a causative relationship between Hp and gastric MALT lymphoma. Patients with chronic HCV infection have 5 times higher risk to develop MZL, in particular, an association with splenic and nodal MZL has been shown in several studies. Moreover, there is evidence of lymphoma regression after antiviral therapy with interferon+ribavirin, thus raising hope that newly available drugs, extremely efficient against HCV replication, could improve outcome also in HCV-driven lymphomas. Another case-study are represented by those rare cases of MZL localized to orbital fat and eye conjunctivas that have been associated with Chlamydophila psittaci infection carried by birds. Efficacy of antibacterial therapy against C. psittaci are conflicting and generally poorer than gastric MALT. Finally, some case reports will cover the relationship between primary cutaneous B-cell Lymphomas and Borrelia Burgdorferi.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major global health issue. Although the search for HCV treatments has resulted in great achievements, the current treatment methods have limitations, and new methods and drugs for hepatitis C treatment are still required. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of artesunate (ART) on HCV replication and compared these effects with those of ribavirin (RBV) and interferon-2b (IFN). The study was performed in HCV-infection cell models (JFH1-infected Huh7.5.1 and OR6 cell lines). Our results showed that the antimalarial drug ART inhibited HCV replicon replication in a dose- and time-dependent manner at a concentration that had no effect on the proliferation of exponentially growing host cells, and the inhibitory effect on HCV replication was stronger than RBV but weaker than IFN, as determined by qPCR, luciferase assays, and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, the combination of ART and IFN resulted in a greater inhibition of HCV replication. These findings demonstrated that ART had an inhibitive effect on HCV replication and may be a novel supplemental co-therapy with IFN and RBV for HCV and as an alternative strategy to combat resistance mechanisms that have emerged in the presence of DAA agents.\",\"Hepatitis disease caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a severe threat to global public health, affecting approximately 3% of the world's population. Sofosbuvir (PSI-7977), a uridine nucleotide analog inhibitor targeting the HCV NS5B polymerase, was approved by FDA at the end of 2013 and represents a key step towards a new era in the management of HCV infection. Previous study identified NITD008, an adenosine nucleoside analog, as the specific inhibitor against dengue virus and showed good antiviral effect on other flaviviruses or enteroviruses. In this report, we systematically analyzed the anti-HCV profile of NITD008, which was discovered to effectively suppress the replication of different strains of HCV in human hepatoma cells with a low nanomolar activity. On genotype 2a virus, or 2a, 1a, and 1b replicon cells, EC50 values were 8.7 nM, 93.3 nM, 60.0 nM and 67.2 nM, and selective index values were >2298.9, >214.4, >333.3, >298.5 respectively. We demonstrated that resistance to NITD008 was conferred by mutation in NS5B (S282T) in the HCV infectious virus genotype 2a (JFH-1). Then, we compared the resistant profiles of NITD008 and PSI-7977, and found that the folds change of EC50 of NITD008 to full replicon cells containing mutation S282T was much bigger than PSI-7977(folds 76.50 vs. 4.52). Analysis of NITD008 cross-resistance against previously reported NS5B drug-selected mutations showed that the resistance pattern of NITD008 was not completely similar to PSI-7977, and meanwhile, S282T resistant mutation to NITD008 emerge more easily in cell culture than PSI-7977. Interestingly, NITD008 displayed significant synergistic effects with the NS5B polymerase inhibitor PSI-7977, however, only additive effects with alpha interferon (IFN\\u03b1-2b), ribavirin, and an NS3 protease inhibitor. These results verify that NITD008 is an effective analog inhibitor against hepatitis C virus and a good research tool as a supplement to other types of nucleoside analogs.\",\"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) can lead to chronic infection in solid-organ transplant patients. Ribavirin is efficient for treatment of chronically infected patients. Recently, the1634R mutation in the HEV polymerase has been associated with treatment failure. However, it is unclear if this mutation can be used as a prognostic marker of treatment outcome. We studied the prevalence of the 1634R mutation in the HEV polymerase of patients starting ribavirin therapy, the influence of the 1634R variants on the viral response, the frequency of the 1634R mutation in patients whose treatment failed, and its impact on ribavirin retreatment. We analyzed pretreatment samples from 63 solid-organ transplant patients with chronic hepatitis E using deep sequencing; 42 patients had a sustained virologic response (SVR), and 21 were non-SVR patients. We detected the 1634R variant by deep sequencing in 36.5% (23/63) of the patients (proportions, 1.3 to 100%). The 1634R variant was detected in 31.0% (13/42) of baseline plasma samples from patients with SVR and in 47.6% (10/21) in the other patients (P = 0.2). The presence of this mutation did not influence the initial decrease in viral RNA. Lastly, a second prolonged ribavirin treatment led to SVR in 70% of the patients who initially did not have SVR, despite the presence of the 1634R variant. We conclude that the presence of the 1634R variant at ribavirin initiation does not lead to absolute ribavirin resistance. Although its proportion increased in patients whose treatment failed, the presence of the 1634R variant did not compromise the response to a second ribavirin treatment.\",\"Approximately 1 million South Africans are infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV). The standard of care (SOC) in South Africa is combination therapy (pegylated interferon and ribavirin). HCV genotypes and/or mutations in the core/non-structural regions have been associated with response to therapy and/or disease progression. This study examines mutations in the core (29-280 amino acids, including \\u223c 90 E1 amino acids) and NS5B (241-306 amino acids) regions on pre-treatment isolates from patients attending Johannesburg hospitals or asymptomatic South African blood donors. Diversity within known CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell epitopes was also explored. Samples grouped into subtypes 1a(N = 10) 1b(N = 12), 3a(N = 5), 4a(N = 3) and 5a(N = 61). Two mutations, associated with interferon resistance-R70Q and T110N-were present in 29 genotype 5a core sequences. No resistance mutation to NS5B nucleotide inhibitors, sofosbuvir was found. Six putative CD8+ and one CD4+ T-cell epitope sequence in the core region showed binding scores of <300 IC50nM to HLA alleles frequently observed in the South African population. No known CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitopes were mapped in the NS5B region. The analysis begs the question whether those infected with genotype 5a will benefit better on interferon-free combination therapies. This study provides new insight into one of the lesser studied HCV genotypes and compares the diversity seen in a large pre-treatment cohort with other subtypes.\",\"Amino acid (aa) 70 substitution (R70Q/H) in the core protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b has been shown to be one of the key factors in determining resistance for pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 plus ribavirin combination therapy (PEG-IFN\\u03b1/RBV). But the exact mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamic response of wild and mutant core codon 70 strains to PEG-IFN\\u03b1/RBV treatment.\",\"Direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based therapy is the new standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, protease inhibitor (PI)-resistant viral variants have been often described. This study aimed to examine HCV-NS3 protease variants at baseline and at 4 weeks under triple therapy. To this end, we analyzed the presence of variants in HCV-NS3 protease region from peripheral blood samples of 16 patients infected with HCV-1 at baseline and at 4 weeks of combined therapy with telaprevir, pegylated interferon, and ribavirin, using next-generation sequencing. Several variants with synonymous and non-synonymous amino acid substitutions were detected at both time points. Variants detected at low frequency corresponded to 74% (HCV-1a) and 35% (HCV-1b) of non-synonymous substitutions. We found nine PI-resistance-associated variants (V36A, T54S, V55I, Q80K, Q80R, V107I, I132V, D168E, M175L) in HCV-NS3 of 10 patients. There was no correspondence of resistance-associated variant profile between baseline and at 4 weeks. Moreover, these resistance variants at baseline and short-term treatment are not good predictors of outcome under triple therapy. Our study also shows a large number of others minor and major non-synonymous variants in HCV-NS3 early in telaprevir-based therapy that can be important for further drug resistance association studies with newly developed PI agents.\",\"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children. In addition, RSV causes significant morbidity and mortality in hospitalized elderly and immunocompromised patients. Currently, only palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the RSV fusion (F) protein, and inhaled ribavirin are approved for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of RSV, respectively. Therefore, there is a clinical need for safe and effective therapeutic agents for RSV infections. GS-5806, discovered via chemical optimization of a hit from a high-throughput antiviral-screening campaign, selectively inhibits a diverse set of 75 RSV subtype A and B clinical isolates (mean 50% effective concentration [EC50] = 0.43 nM). The compound maintained potency in primary human airway epithelial cells and exhibited low cytotoxicity in human cell lines and primary cell cultures (selectivity > 23,000-fold). Time-of-addition and temperature shift studies demonstrated that GS-5806 does not block RSV attachment to cells but interferes with virus entry. Follow-up experiments showed potent inhibition of RSV F-mediated cell-to-cell fusion. RSV A and B variants resistant to GS-5806, due to mutations in F protein (RSV A, L138F or F140L/N517I, and RSV B, F488L or F488S), were isolated and showed cross-resistance to other RSV fusion inhibitors, such as VP-14637, but remained fully sensitive to palivizumab and ribavirin. In summary, GS-5806 is a potent and selective RSV fusion inhibitor with antiviral activity against a diverse set of RSV clinical isolates. The compound is currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of RSV infection in pediatric, immunocompromised, and elderly patients.\",\"Insulin resistance (IR) modifies the anti-viral effects of interferon (IFN) therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). This prospective study evaluated whether lifestyle interventions improve the anti-viral response to treatment with pegylated (PEG)-IFN plus ribavirin (RBV) in patients with CHC.\",\"For many years, the standard of treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was a combination of pegylated interferon alpha (Peg-IFN-\\u03b1) and ribavirin for 24-48 weeks. This treatment regimen results in a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate in about 50% of cases. The failure of IFN-\\u03b1-based therapy to eliminate HCV is a result of multiple factors including a suboptimal treatment regimen, severity of HCV-related diseases, host factors and viral factors. In recent years, advances in HCV cell culture have contributed to a better understanding of the viral life cycle, which has led to the development of a number of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) that target specific key components of viral replication, such as HCV NS3/4A, HCV NS5A, and HCV NS5B proteins. To date, several new drugs have been approved for the treatment of HCV infection. Application of DAAs with IFN-based or IFN-free regimens has increased the SVR rate up to >90% and has allowed treatment duration to be shortened to 12-24 weeks. The impact of HCV proteins in response to IFN-based and IFN-free therapies has been described in many reports. This review summarizes and updates knowledge on molecular mechanisms of HCV proteins involved in anti-IFN activity as well as examining amino acid variations and mutations in several regions of HCV proteins associated with the response to IFN-based therapy and pattern of resistance associated amino acid variants (RAV) to antiviral agents.\",\"Over the last several years, many advances have been made in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with the development of direct-acting antivirals. Paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir with dasabuvir (PrOD) is a novel combination of a nonstructural (NS) 3/4A protein inhibitor boosted by ritonavir, an NS5A protein inhibitor, and an NS5B nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitor. This review aims to discuss the pharmacology, efficacy, safety, drug interactions, and viral drug resistance of PrOD in the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infections. Phase I, II, and III human and animal studies that describe the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of PrOD for HCV were identified and included. Studies that evaluated patients without cirrhosis (n=2,249) and with cirrhosis (n=422) demonstrated that PrOD for 12 or 24 weeks was effective at achieving sustained virologic response rates (>90%) in patients with genotype 1a or 1b HCV infection. Although indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection, PrOD is also recommended for the treatment of HCV in patients coinfected with HIV. Additionally, promising data exist for the use of PrOD in liver-transplant recipients. The most common adverse drug events associated with PrOD included nausea, pruritus, insomnia, diarrhea, asthenia, dry skin, vomiting, and anemia. The high efficacy rates seen coupled with a favorable side effect profile seen with PrOD with or without ribavirin have led to its addition as a recommended treatment regimen for HCV genotype 1 infection.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C is a systemic disease inducing metabolic alterations leading to extrahepatic consequences. In particular, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection seems to increase the risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus in predisposed individuals, independently of liver disease stage. The mechanisms through which hepatitis C induces T2DM involve direct viral effects, insulin resistance, pro-inflammatory cytokines and other immune-mediated processes. Many studies have reported the clinical consequences of type 2 diabetes mellitus on hepatitis C outcome, but very few studies have addressed the issue of microangiopathic complications among patients with hepatitis C only, who develop type 2 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, clinical trials in HCV-positive patients have reported improvement in glucose metabolism after antiviral treatment; recent studies have suggested that this metabolic amelioration might have a clinical impact on type 2 diabetes mellitus-related complications. These observations raise the question as to whether the HCV eradication may also have an impact on the future morbidity and mortality due to type 2 diabetes mellitus. The scope of this review is to summarise the current evidence linking successful antiviral treatment and the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications in hepatitis C-infected patients.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major health concern worldwide. Interferon-\\u03b1 (IFN-\\u03b1) therapy has been the main antiviral treatment for more than 20 years. Because of its established antitumor effects, IFN-based treatments for chronic HCV infection still have a clinical impact, particularly for patients with high risk conditions of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, such as older age and advanced liver fibrosis. As a result of exhaustive research, several viral factors, including NS5A amino acid mutations such as the IFN sensitivity-determining region and the IFN/ribavirin resistance-determining region, and mutations of amino acids in the core protein region (core 70 and 91) were shown to be associated with the response to IFN-\\u03b1 treatment. In addition, among the host factors related to the response to IFN-\\u03b1 treatment, polymorphisms of the interleukin-28B gene were identified to be the most important factor. In this article, we review the factors associated with the efficacy of IFN-\\u03b1 treatment for chronic HCV infection. In addition, our recent findings regarding the possible involvement of anti-IFN-\\u03b1 neutralizing antibodies in a non-response to pegylated-IFN-\\u03b1 treatment are also described.\",\"Sofosbuvir (SOF) exhibits a high barrier to resistance, with no S282T NS5B substitution or phenotypic resistance detected in phase 3 registration studies.\",\"Approximately 3% of the world's population is chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). In some southeast Asian countries the prevalence of HCV (\\u223c6%-7%) far exceeds that seen in the United States (1.8%). The lesser known HCV genotype 6 (HCV-6) is also common in patients from southeast Asia and the surrounding regions. Most data on direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) to date have been derived from clinical trials conducted in Western countries, where HCV-6 is rare. The standard of care for patients with HCV-6 is still pegylated interferon and ribavirin. However, data are emerging for several DAA combinations.\",\"The combination of ombitasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), paritaprevir (an NS3/4A inhibitor) coadministered with ritonavir (r), and dasabuvir (an NS5B nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitor), referred to as the 3D regimen, and the combination of ombitasvir-paritaprevir-r, referred to as the 2D regimen, have demonstrated high efficacy with and without ribavirin in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected subjects. These regimens have potential for coadministration with sofosbuvir (nucleoside NS5B inhibitor) in the treatment of HCV. This phase 1, drug-drug interaction, open-label, multiple-dose study enrolled 32 healthy subjects to receive the 3D or 2D regimen in combination with sofosbuvir. Doses of study drugs were as follows: ombitasvir-paritaprevir-r, 25/150/100 mg daily (QD); dasabuvir, 250 mg twice daily (BID); and sofosbuvir, 400 mg QD. Blood samples were collected on study days 7, 14, and 21 for evaluating drug interaction at steady state. The effect of the 3D and 2D regimens on the pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir and its circulating metabolite GS-331007 and vice versa was assessed by a repeated-measures analysis. Exposures of the 3D and 2D regimens were similar (\\u226420% change) during coadministration with sofosbuvir and during administration alone. Sofosbuvir exposures were 61% to 112% higher with the 3D regimen and 64% to 93% higher with the 2D regimen than with sofosbuvir alone. GS-331007 total exposures were 27% and 32% higher with the 3D and 2D regimens, respectively, than with sofosbuvir alone. Increases in sofosbuvir and GS-331007 exposures likely resulted from breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and/or P glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter inhibition by paritaprevir and ritonavir. No subjects discontinued the study due to study drug-related adverse events. No dose adjustment is recommended for 3D, 2D, or sofosbuvir in clinical trials exploring the safety and efficacy of the combination. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT02356562 and NCT02292719.).\",\"Sofsobuvir is the first-in-class NS5B nucleotide inhibitor to be launched as a treatment for the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Its viral potency, pan genotypic activity and high barrier to resistance make it the ideal candidate to become a backbone for several IFN-free regimens. Ledipasvir is a NS5A inhibitor with multi genotypic activity but modest barrier to resistance. The once-daily fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir is the first-in-market single-tablet regimen for the treatment of hepatitis C infection. Recent data demonstrated that this FDC alone, or in combination with ribavirin, is able to achieve HCV cure of at least 90% or more among genotype 1,4, 5 and 6 patients. This combination appears to be suboptimal in genotype 3 patients and other direct acting antiviral combinations with sofosbuvir will help to fulfill this gap in the near future. The safety profile of the fixed dose combination is good. Resistance is not an issue with sofosbuvir but may be a significant issue with regards to ledipasvir for those rare individuals who harbor baseline HCV NS5A resistance-associated variants that conferred a high resistance level. The rational for using FDCs and the available clinical data are reviewed.\",\"Current combination therapy of PEG-INF and ribavirin against the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype-1 infections is ineffective in maintaining sustained viral response in 50% of the infection cases. New compounds in the form of protease inhibitors can complement the combination therapy. Asunaprevir is new to the drug regiment as the NS3-4A protease inhibitor, but it is susceptible to two mutations, namely, R155K and D168A in the protein. Thus, in our study, we sought to evaluate Andrographolide, a labdane-diterpenoid from the Andrographis paniculata plant as an effective compound for inhibiting the NS3-4A protease as well as its concomitant drug-resistant mutants by using molecular docking and dynamic simulations. Our study shows that Andrographolide has best docking scores of -15.0862, -15.2322, and -13.9072 compared to those of Asunaprevir -3.7159, -2.6431, and -5.4149 with wild-type R155K and D168A mutants, respectively. Also, as shown in the MD simulations, the compound was good in binding the target proteins and maintains strong bonds causing very less to negligible perturbation in the protein backbone structures. Our results validate the susceptibility of Asunaprevir to protein variants as seen from our docking studies and trajectory period analysis. Therefore, from our study, we hope to add one more option in the drug regiment to tackle drug resistance in HCV infections.\",\"In phase 2 trials, treatment with the combination of the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir and the NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir resulted in high rates of sustained virologic response in patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 or 3.\",\"As the population that is infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) ages, the number of patients with decompensated cirrhosis is expected to increase.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects nearly 1.3% of US population and around 2% of people worldwide. It is associated with serious complication of Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular carcinoma leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Until now the only treatment option for this serious disease was interferon based therapy which had poor tolerance and at best SVR (Sustained virological response) in only 50% of cases. With the introduction of other direct - acting antiviral agents the treatment of HCV has been revolutionized with significantly high rates of cure. Among novel Direct acting antivirals are non-nucleoside inhibitor NS5B which is highly effective in treatment of HCV genotype 1 a and 1b including those with compensated cirrhosis achieving high cure rates with SVR more than 97 % in pooled analysis from six different phase 3 trials. This review will discuss the DAA - Dasabuvir, a non - nucleoside NS5B inhibitor, its mechanism of action, efficacy, safety & tolerance, and drug resistance. Dasabuvir is approved by FDA in combination with other DAA agents called as the 3D(Viekira Pak) in various interferon free regimens achieving high cure rates (SVR >95%) with low adverse effects. In Europe, it is approved by European medicines agency for use in combination with Ombitasvir, Paritaprevir, and ritonavir with or without ribavirin. The drug is used in treatment naive as well as previously treated patient with high success rates. It is also approved in patients with compensated cirrhosis, patients with HIV co-infection and liver transplant recipients which were in the past were excluded from treatment with interferon based therapy. Dasabuvir is extensively evaluated in large clinical trials and shown excellent SVR among HCV genotype1 patient population in combination with other oral DAAs, with good safety profile and tolerance. Its drawback is its genotype restriction, need for ribavirin (RBV) for 1a genotype, low resistance barrier and high cost. It is well tolerated with less than 1 % of patients permanently discontinuing treatment and 2% of patient experiencing a serious adverse reaction. It is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ritonavir (e.g. Steven - Johnson syndrome) and strong inducers of CYP3A and CYP2CB.\",\"Sofosbuvir is the first pan-genotypic direct acting antiviral agent to be approved. This article provides an overview of the pharmacology of sofosbuvir and ribavirin and a comprehensive summary of the phase 2 and 3 studies supporting dual sofosbuvir and ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection. With the production of generic formulations of sofosbuvir, we anticipate this regimen leading the first wave for widespread, IFN-free treatment and becoming first line for all genotypes (including genotype 1) for much of the world-in particular in developing and middle income countries. We discuss the continued challenges with this regimen including among patients with decompensated liver disease and post-liver transplant, and renal failure. We address concerns of emerging resistance. We also discuss the future prospects including the global uptake of sofosbuvir and ribavirin for the treatment of all genotypes.\",\"The combination of hepatitis B immune globulin with entecavir or tenofovir (at least for a certain period of time) seems to be the most reasonable prophylaxis against recurrent hepatitis B after liver transplantation. Entecavir represents an attractive option for treatment of na\\u00efve kidney transplant recipients, because of its high efficacy and the low rates of resistance. However antiviral treatment should be individualized in the view of kidney function and the previous resistance. To date, new captivating therapeutic strategies could make interferon-free regimens viable for treatment of hepatitis C virus positive liver transplant recipients. The recent combinations of sofosbuvir with simeprevir or daclatasvir or ledipasvir plus/minus ribavirin have boosted the on treatment and sustained virological response to rates approaching 100% within liver transplant recipients with recurrent chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Preliminary data showed that the second generation direct oral antivirals could result to high treatment rates of recurrent CHC in kidney transplant recipients as well. Ongoing studies will clarify the optimal treatment of recurrent CHC in kidney transplant recipients.\",\"Within the development and approval of several new direct-acting antivirals (DAA) against hepatitis C virus (HCV), a new era of hepatitis C therapy has begun. Even more treatment options are likely to become available during the next 1-2 years.\",\"Effective, pangenotypic treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are needed.\",\"Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) combined with pegylated-interferon (PegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV) are still a standard treatment in patients with genotype 1HCV infection. However, virologic response could be impaired by baseline or early selection of resistant HCV strains.\",\"Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and cirrhosis have a higher risk for liver-related complications and have historically been more difficult to cure than patients without cirrhosis. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir, without ribavirin, for 12weeks in patients with HCV genotype 1b infection and compensated cirrhosis.\",\"We evaluated the combination of daclatasvir (pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor) and simeprevir (NS3/4A protease inhibitor), with or without ribavirin, in hepatitis C virus genotype 1-infected patients.\",\"Standard of care for chronic hepatitis C in Japan is currently a pegylated interferon (IFN)-\\u03b1 + ribavirin (PR)-based regimen, notably associated with efficacy and tolerability issues.

This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of the daclatasvir + asunaprevir (DCV + ASV) DAA regimen in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b who had previously not responded to or were ineligible for IFN-containing regimens.\",\"There is an unmet need for interferon- and ribavirin-free treatment for chronic HCV infection in patients with comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the rates of sustained virological response (SVR) and adverse events in a cohort of patients with nosocomially acquired HCV genotype-1b following 12 weeks of therapy with fixed-dose combination (FDC) ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF).\",\"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a pandemic human pathogen posing a substantial health and economic burden in both developing and developed countries. Controlling the spread of HCV through behavioural prevention strategies has met with limited success and vaccine development remains slow. The development of antiviral therapeutic agents has also been challenging, primarily due to the lack of efficient cell culture and animal models for all HCV genotypes, as well as the large genetic diversity between HCV strains. On the other hand, the use of interferon-\\u03b1-based treatments in combination with the guanosine analogue, ribavirin, achieved limited success, and widespread use of these therapies has been hampered by prevalent side effects. For more than a decade, the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) has been targeted for antiviral development, and direct-acting antivirals (DAA) have been identified which bind to one of at least six RdRp inhibitor-binding sites, and are now becoming a mainstay of highly effective and well tolerated antiviral treatment for HCV infection. Here we review the different classes of RdRp inhibitors and their mode of action against HCV. Furthermore, the mechanism of antiviral resistance to each class is described, including naturally occurring resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in different viral strains and genotypes. Finally, we review the impact of these RAVs on treatment outcomes with the newly developed regimens.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one of the leading causes of end-stage liver disease and the main indication for liver transplantation (LT) in most countries. All patients who undergo LT with detectable serum HCV RNA experience graft reinfection progressing to cirrhosis within five years in 20% to 30% of them. Obtaining a sustained virological response (SVR) greatly improves overall and graft survival. Until 2011, standard antiviral therapy using PEGylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) was the only effective therapy, with an SVR rate around 30% in this setting. For patients infected with genotype 1, first generation NS3/4A protease inhibitors (PIs), boceprevir (BOC) or telaprevir (TVR), associated with PEG-IFN and RBV for 48 weeks have increased the SVR rates to 60% in non-transplant patients. However, tolerability and drug-drug interactions with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) are both limiting factors of their use in the liver transplant setting. Over recent years, the efficacy of antiviral C therapy has improved dramatically using new direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents without PEG-IFN and/or RBV, leading to SVR rates over 90% in non-transplant patients. Results available for transplant patients showed a better efficacy and tolerability and less drug-drug interactions than with first wave PIs. However, some infrequent cases of viral resistance have been reported using PIs or NS5A inhibitors pre- or post-LT that can lead to difficulties in the management of these patients.\",\"Despite available treatment, Hepatitis C remains one of most serious burdens to public health. Current therapy based on pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin has significant side effects and its effectiveness varies for different genotypes of the virus. Four novel drugs - viral protease inhibitors (telaprevir, boceprevir, simeprevir) and polymerase inhibitor - sofosbuvir have been introduced in last years for use in combination with standard-of-care treatment. For the first time interferon free therapies were approved with the use of combination of sofosbuvir+ribavirin. New therapies improve virological response rates but also increase the cost, side effects and raise the issue of drug resistance. Numerous novel anti-HCV compounds have been evaluated in advanced clinical trials including inhibitors of viral proteins (protease, polymerase and NS5A) and inhibitors of host factors involved in HCV replication (cyclophilin A, microRNA - miR-122). New interferon-free therapies reducing severe side effects are expected to enter the market within few months. At the same time efforts are undertaken to determine the host and viral factors with predictive value for HCV treatment response, enabling personalized therapy approach. The main success in this field was the discovery of interleukin IL28B polymorphism, which correlates with positive standard-of-care treatment response. An effective vaccination may be an alternative for antiviral drugs, but no anti-HCV vaccine is available currently. It is well proved that successful vaccination should induce antibody and T-cell responses specific against a range of HCV genotypes. With this aim, new subunit and genetic candidate vaccines have been evaluated in I and II phase clinical trials. This review summarizes the recent developments in the field of new drug development and vaccine studies against hepatitis C virus.\",\"Influenza is a major cause of severe respiratory infections leading to excessive hospitalizations and deaths globally; annual epidemics, pandemics, and sporadic/endemic avian virus infections occur as a result of rapid, continuous evolution of influenza viruses. Emergence of antiviral resistance is of great clinical and public health concern. Currently available antiviral treatments include four neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, laninamivir), M2-inibitors (amantadine, rimantadine), and a polymerase inhibitor (favipiravir). In this review, we focus on resistance issues related to the use of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs). Data on primary resistance, as well as secondary resistance related to NAI exposure will be presented. Their clinical implications, detection, and novel therapeutic options undergoing clinical trials are discussed.\",\"The phase 2 C-SALVAGE study (Hepatitis C-Salvage Study for Patients who Failed DAA/PR Therapy) demonstrated a 96.2% sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12) rate using the NS3/4A protease inhibitor grazoprevir and the NS5A inhibitor elbasvir together with ribavirin in treatment-experienced patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection.\",\"We investigated the susceptibility of 10 enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) isolates (belonging to clusters A, B, and C) to (entero)virus inhibitors with different mechanisms of action. The 3C-protease inhibitors proved to be more efficient than enviroxime and pleconaril, which in turn were more effective than vapendavir and pirodavir. Favipiravir proved to be a weak inhibitor. Resistance to pleconaril maps to V69A in the VP1 protein, and resistance to rupintrivir maps to V104I in the 3C protease. A structural explanation of why both substitutions may cause resistance is provided.\",\"The presence of resistance-associated variants (RAVs) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) attenuates the efficacy of direct acting antivirals (DAAs).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of grazoprevir at doses of 25-100 mg/day in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV). In this randomized, dose-ranging, multicentre trial, treatment-naive adults with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection received once-daily grazoprevir 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg plus PEG-IFN/RBV for 12 weeks. Patients with quantifiable HCV RNA (\\u226525 IU/mL) at week 4 received an additional 12 weeks of PEG-IFN/RBV. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (HCV RNA <25 IU/mL 12 weeks after completing therapy [SVR12]). Eighty-seven patients were randomly assigned and received \\u22651 dose of therapy. Median time to undetectable HCV RNA was 16 days in the 100-mg arm and 22 days in the 25- and 50-mg arms. All patients except one had HCV RNA undetectable or unquantifiable at week 4 and received 12 weeks of therapy. SVR12 was achieved by 13 of 24 (54.2%), 21 of 25 (84.0%) and 23 of 26 (88.5%) patients in the 25-, 50- and 100-mg arms, respectively (per-protocol analysis). Three patients discontinued as a result of nonserious adverse events (AEs) and three patients experienced serious AEs. Transaminase elevations occurred in two patients (one each in the 25- and 100-mg arms).\",\"The addition of the first direct-acting antiviral agents, the NS3 protease inhibitors boceprevir or telaprevir, to peg interferon and ribavirin was a major advance in the treatment of genotype 1 hepatitis C individuals with sustained virological response (SVR) rates of 63-75 %. Those who did not achieve SVR had high rates of resistance-associated variants against NS3 protease domain. Retreatment options for those who have failed first-generation protease inhibitors generally are guided by retreatment with direct-acting antiviral agents from other classes. Phase 2 and phase 3 data have demonstrated that retreatment with 12-24 weeks of a NS5B inhibitor (sofosbuvir) in combination with a NS5a inhibitor (daclatasvir or ledipasvir) with or without ribavirin can achieve SVR at high rates comparable to treatment-naive individuals.\",\"To evaluate virological response to telaprevir or boceprevir in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin and resistance mutations to NS3/4A inhibitors in hepatitis C virus-human immunodeficiency virus (HCV-HIV) coinfected patients in a real life setting.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with several extrahepatic manifestations. Patients with HCV may develop mixed cryoglobulinemia and its sequelae, ranging from cutaneous and visceral vasculitis to glomerulonephritis and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. HCV-infected patients have increased rates of insulin resistance, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, which may lead to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Neurological manifestations of HCV infection include fatigue and cognitive impairment. The mechanisms causing the extrahepatic effects of HCV infection are likely multifactorial and may include endocrine effects, HCV replication in extrahepatic cells, or a heightened immune reaction with systemic effects. Successful eradication of HCV with interferon alfa and ribavirin was shown to improve some of these extrahepatic effects; sustained virological response is associated with resolution of complications of cryoglobulinemia, reduced levels of insulin resistance, reduced incidence of diabetes and stroke, and improved fatigue and cognitive functioning. The availability of new interferon-free, well-tolerated anti-HCV treatment regimens is broadening the spectrum of patients available for therapy, including those in whom interferon was contraindicated, and will likely result in greater improvements in the extrahepatic manifestations of HCV. If these regimens are shown to confer significant benefit in the metabolic, cardiovascular, or neuropsychiatric conditions associated with HCV infection, extrahepatic manifestations of HCV may become a major indication for treatment even in the absence of liver disease.\",\"To date, the majority of work on RNA virus replication fidelity has focused on the viral RNA polymerase, while the potential role of other viral replicase proteins in this process is poorly understood. Previous studies used resistance to broad-spectrum RNA mutagens, such as ribavirin, to identify polymerases with increased fidelity that avoid misincorporation of such base analogues. We identified a novel variant in the alphavirus viral helicase/protease, nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) that operates in concert with the viral polymerase nsP4 to further alter replication complex fidelity, a functional linkage that was conserved among the alphavirus genus. Purified chikungunya virus nsP2 presented delayed helicase activity of the high-fidelity enzyme, and yet purified replication complexes manifested stronger RNA polymerization kinetics. Because mutagenic nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin also affect intracellular nucleotide pools, we addressed the link between nucleotide depletion and replication fidelity by using purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors. High-fidelity viruses were more resistant to these conditions, and viral growth could be rescued by the addition of exogenous nucleosides, suggesting that mutagenesis by base analogues requires nucleotide pool depletion. This study describes a novel function for nsP2, highlighting the role of other components of the replication complex in regulating viral replication fidelity, and suggests that viruses can alter their replication complex fidelity to overcome intracellular nucleotide-depleting conditions.\",\"Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are at a greater risk of developing insulin resistance (IR). However, little is known about when insulin sensitivity may improve during or after treatment for hepatitis C. In this study, we examined the effect of combination therapy with pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin on IR in patients with chronic HCV infection. We also analyzed factors associated with changes in insulin sensitivity. IR was estimated by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). HOMA-IR was measured before therapy, during therapy (12 and 24 weeks), and at the end of therapy (EOT; 24 or 48 weeks). We analyzed 78 HCV patients receiving combination therapy. Twenty-two patients (28.2%) exhibited pretreatment IR (HOMA-IR >2.5). In all patients, HOMA-IR was not significantly different from baseline values at 12 weeks (P = 0.823), 24 weeks (P = 0.417), or at EOT (P = 0.158). In patients with pretreatment IR, a significant decrease in HOMA-IR was observed at 12 weeks (P = 0.023), 24 weeks (P = 0.008), and at EOT (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model showed that baseline HOMA-IR is the only factor associated with the decline in HOMA-IR during and after therapy. The eradication of HCV infection was associated with improved insulin sensitivity among patients with pretreatment IR. This significant improvement in insulin sensitivity may occur as early as 12 weeks after the initiation of antiviral therapy.\",\"Myxoviruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are major human pathogens, mandating the development of novel therapeutics. To establish a high-throughput screening protocol for the simultaneous identification of pathogen- and host-targeted hit candidates against either pathogen or both, we have attempted co-infection of cells with IAV and RSV. However, viral replication kinetics were incompatible, RSV signal window was low, and an IAV-driven minireplicon reporter assay used in initial screens narrowed the host cell range and restricted the assay to single-cycle infections. To overcome these limitations, we developed an RSV strain carrying firefly luciferase fused to an innovative universal small-molecule assisted shut-off domain, which boosted assay signal window, and a hyperactive fusion protein that synchronized IAV and RSV reporter expression kinetics and suppressed the identification of RSV entry inhibitors sensitive to a recently reported RSV pan-resistance mechanism. Combined with a replication-competent recombinant IAV strain harboring nanoluciferase, the assay performed well on a human respiratory cell line and supports multicycle infections. Miniaturized to 384-well format, the protocol was validated through screening of a set of the National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection (NCC) in quadruplicate. These test screens demonstrated favorable assay parameters and reproducibility. Application to a LOPAC library of bioactive compounds in a proof-of-concept campaign detected licensed antimyxovirus therapeutics, ribavirin and the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir, and identified two unexpected RSV-specific hit candidates, Fenretinide and the opioid receptor antagonist BNTX-7. Hits were evaluated in direct and orthogonal dose-response counterscreens using a standard recRSV reporter strain expressing Renilla luciferase.\",\"Treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has progressed at remarkable speed. From poorly tolerated injectable therapy with very low cure rates, treatment has moved to highly effective well-tolerated all oral direct-acting antiviral therapies with cure rates above 90% for almost all patients populations. Direct-acting antivirals have developed out of an improved understanding of the viral lifecycle with recognition of targets that could be inhibited by small molecules. To date protease inhibitors, non-structural 5a inhibitors and nucleotide and non-nucleotide polymerase inhibitors have been developed. These agents have been used initially with peginterferon and ribavirin and subsequently in combination without the need for interferon. Rational combinations have overcome the major challenge of rapid emergence of drug resistance and second-generation agents in each class have improved safety and efficacy profiles with fewer drug-drug interactions and very few adverse effects. The progress of direct-acting antiviral development is outlined with a review of each class of agent as well as a discussion of challenges for the future.\",\"Failure to respond to the approved combinations of multiple direct-acting antiviral agents is relatively low in hepatitis C virus treatment registration studies, with rates of 1% to 7%, depending on the patients' baseline characteristics. In real life, failure is slightly higher, likely because of lower compliance. Treatment failures are usually related to relapse and less often to on-treatment viral breakthrough. Hepatitis C drug-resistant variants are detected in most patients who do not achieve viral eradication. The risk of developing these variants depends on host- and virus-related factors, the properties of the drugs used, and the treatment strategies applied. Patients who carry resistance-associated variants may not obtain benefits from treatment and are at risk of disease progression and transmission of the variants. Whether hepatitis C resistance-associated variants persist depends on their type: NS3-4A variants often disappear gradually after therapy is stopped, whereas NS5A variants tend to persist for more than 2 years. The best way to prevent emergence of resistant variants is to eliminate the virus at the first treatment using highly potent antivirals with genetic barriers to resistance. In patients failing first-generation protease inhibitors, combination therapies with sofosbuvir and NS5 inhibitors have proven effective. Some salvage regimens can be shortened to 12 weeks by addition of ribavirin. The optimal treatment for patients who fail an NS5A inhibitor and those with multidrug-resistant variants remains to be defined, and research efforts should continue to focus on treatment for these patients.\",\"Viral dynamic modelling has proven useful for designing clinical studies and predicting treatment outcomes for patients infected with the hepatitis C virus. Generally these models aim to capture and predict the on-treatment viral load dynamics from a small study of individual patients. Here, we explored extending these models (1) to clinical studies with numerous patients and (2) by incorporating additional data types, including sequence data and prior response to interferon. Data from Phase 3 clinical studies of the direct-acting antiviral telaprevir (T; total daily dose of 2250 mg) combined with pegylated-interferon alfa and ribavirin (PR) were used for the analysis. The following data in the treatment-na\\u00efve population were reserved to verify the model: (1) a T/PR regimen where T was dosed every 8 h for 8 weeks (T8(q8h)/PR) and (2) a T/PR regimen where T was dosed twice daily for 12 weeks (T12(b.i.d.)/PR). The resulting model accurately predicted (1) sustained virologic response rates for both of these dosing regimens and (2) viral breakthrough characteristics of the T8(q8h)/PR regimen. Since the observed viral variants depend on the T exposure, the second verification suggested that the model was correctly sensitive to the different T regimen even though the model was developed using data from another T regimen. Furthermore, the model predicted that b.i.d. T dosing was comparable to q8h T dosing in the PR-experienced population, a comparison that has not been made in a controlled clinical study. The methods developed in this work to estimate the variability occurring below the limit of detection for the viral load were critical for making accurate predictions.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4 (GT4) is genetically diverse, with 17 confirmed subtypes, and comprises approximately 13% of infections worldwide. In this study, we identified GT4 subtypes by phylogenetic analysis, assessed differences in patient demographics across GT4 subtypes, examined baseline sequence variability among subtypes and the potential impact on treatment outcome, and analyzed the development of viral resistance in patients who received a regimen of ombitasvir (nonstructural protein 5A [NS5A] inhibitor) plus ritonavir-boosted paritaprevir (NS3/4A inhibitor) with or without ribavirin (RBV) for the treatment of HCV GT4 infection. Phylogenetic analysis of HCV NS3/4A, NS5A, and NS5B nucleotide sequences identified 7 subtypes (4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4f, 4g/4k, and 4o) among 132 patient samples. Subtype prevalence varied by country, and the distributions of patient birth cohort and race were significantly different across GT4 subtypes 4a, 4d, and non-4a/4d. Baseline amino acid variability was detected in NS5A across GT4 subtypes but had no impact on treatment outcome. Three patients experienced virologic failure and were infected with subtype 4d, and the predominant resistance-associated variants at the time of failure were D168V in NS3 and L28V in NS5A. Overall, high response rates were observed among patients infected with 7 HCV GT4 subtypes, with no impact of baseline variants on treatment outcome. GT4 subtype distribution in this study differed based on patient demographics and geography.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a common liver disease worldwide with a high rate of chronicity (75-80%) in infected individuals. The chronic form of HCV leads to steatosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellualr carcinoma. Steatosis is prevalent in HCV patients (55%) due to a combination of viral factors (effect of viral proteins on some of the intracellular pathways) and host factors (overweight, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol consumption). The response rates to treatment of chronic HCV with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and (in the case of genotype-1 HCV, the most common infecting genotype in the USA) ribavirin (RBV) is low, with a sustained viral response rate \\u2264 40%. Adding direct-acting antiviral agents-recently approved by the FDA-to the standard protocol has increased the response rate; however HCV-related end-stage liver disease is still the primary indication for liver transplantation in the USA. The focus of this article is on the interrelation between HCV, steatosis and metabolic syndrome.\",\"Influenza is a major cause of substantial morbidity and mortality in humans every year. Vaccination is the main strategy to prevent influenza infection, but antiviral agents also play an important role in the control of both seasonal and pandemic influenza. During the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009, early prompt antiviral therapy may have reduced the severity of the influenza outcomes including pneumonia, hospitalization and mortality in the Republic of Korea. Since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, there have been increasing usages of antiviral agents for the treatment of patients with seasonal influenza. Although currently rare, antiviral resistance among influenza viruses may emerge and increase with increased use of neuraminidase inhibitors. New agents with different modes of action are under investigation, including favipiravir, DAS181, nitazoxanide and broad-spectrum neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Data are limited with respect to high-dose and combination antiviral therapies. So, clinical trials are warranted to evaluate diverse antiviral combinations that may be synergistic and less likely to induce breakthrough resistance.\",\"In the era of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotyping tests at baseline are controversial. The HCV NS3-Q80K polymorphism is associated with resistance to the recently approved NS3 inhibitor simeprevir (SMV) when combined with PEG-interferon and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) and alternative therapy should be considered for patients with baseline Q80K. The aim of this study was to provide an estimate of Q80K prevalence at baseline in a study group of 205 DAA-na\\u00efve patients (21% of them with HIV coinfection) using NS3 full-population direct sequencing to detect resistance-associated amino acid variants (RAVs). NS3 RAVs were identified in 56 patients (27.3%). Q80K was the most frequently reported one (41%), in both HIV/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected patients, but it was only detectable in cases of HCV-subtype 1a infection. Therefore, in clinical practice, an NS3-Q80K genotyping test prior to simeprevir plus PEG-IFN/RBV treatment is highly recommended.\",\"Thrombocytopaenia and hypoalbuminaemia are surrogate markers for portal hypertension and hepatic synthetic dysfunction respectively. Patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) with these surrogates have reduced likelihood of sustained virologic response and increased risk for hepatic decompensation or death when treated with peginterferon/ribavirin plus either telaprevir or boceprevir.\",\"This article examines the dynamics and factors underlying hepatitis C virus (HCV) resistance, along with their impact on daily clinical management of HCV-infected patients.\",\"Dual oral therapy with daclatasvir plus asunaprevir yielded an SVR rate of 85% among patients with genotype 1b HCV. Treatment failure mainly occurred in patients with pre-existing HCV with NS5A-Y93H mutation. The significance of the mutation was evaluated.\",\"Alisporivir (ALV) is an oral, host-targeting agent with pangenotypic anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity and a high barrier to resistance.\",\"To examined the efficacy and safety of treatment with boceprevir, PEGylated-interferon and ribavirin (PR) in hepatitis C virus genotype 1 (HCVGT1) PR treatment-failures in Asia.\",\"Analysis of data pooled from multiple phase 2 (SILEN-C1 to 3) and phase 3 studies (STARTVerso1 to 4) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 3/4A (NS3/4A) protease inhibitor faldaprevir plus pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin (PR) provides a comprehensive evaluation of baseline and treatment-emergent NS3/4A amino acid variants among HCV genotype-1 (GT-1)-infected patients. Pooled analyses of GT-1a and GT-1b NS3 population-based pretreatment sequences (n = 3,124) showed that faldaprevir resistance-associated variants (RAVs) at NS3 R155 and D168 were rare (<1%). No single, noncanonical NS3 protease or NS4A cofactor baseline polymorphism was associated with a reduced sustained virologic response (SVR) to faldaprevir plus PR, including Q80K. The GT-1b NS3 helicase polymorphism T344I was associated with reduced SVR to faldaprevir plus PR (P < 0.0001) but was not faldaprevir specific, as reduced SVR was also observed with placebo plus PR. Among patients who did not achieve SVR and had available NS3 population sequences (n = 507 GT-1a; n = 349 GT-1b), 94% of GT-1a and 83% of GT-1b encoded faldaprevir treatment-emergent RAVs. The predominant GT-1a RAV was R155K (88%), whereas GT-1b encoded D168 substitutions (78%) in which D168V was predominant (67%). The novel GT-1b NS3 S61L substitution emerged in 7% of virologic failures as a covariant with D168V, most often among the faldaprevir breakthroughs; S61L in combination with D168V had a minimal impact on faldaprevir susceptibility compared with that for D168V alone (1.5-fold difference in vitro). The median time to loss of D168 RAVs among GT-1b-infected patients who did not have a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks posttreatment (non-SVR12) after virologic failure was 5 months, which was shorter than the 14 months for R155 RAVs among GT-1a-infected non-SVR12 patients, suggesting that D168V is less fit than R155K in the absence of faldaprevir selective pressure.\",\"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is yearly responsible for approximately 20 million infections worldwide. Although most infections occur in developing countries, HEV appears to be an emerging problem in several industrialized countries, where it is mostly associated with either traveling to an HEV endemic area or contact with pigs, which represent a major reservoir of HEV. The major risk groups for HEV infection and its ensuing complications are elderly men, pregnant women, young children, immunocompromised patients, patients with preexisting liver disease, and workers that come into close contact with HEV-infected animals. Whereas HEV mainly causes acute self-limiting infections, chronic infections may occur among immunocompromised patients (e.g., transplant recipients and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-infected patients). Accordingly, HEV-HIV coinfection leads to accelerated liver cirrhosis and increased mortality rates compared to HEV infection alone, which is, except during pregnancy, usually associated with only low mortality. In the Western world, the most common genotype (gt) causing HEV infection is gt 3. Ribavirin (RBV) and interferon have been used successfully for treatment of HEV, but this treatment is contraindicated in certain patient groups. Therefore, novel antiviral compounds are highly needed, especially given that viral isolates with RBV resistance have been recently identified. Moreover, eradication of HEV is hampered by long-term environmental persistence of the virus, which represents a continuous source of the virus. In 2011, the first prophylactic HEV vaccine, Hecolin, was approved in China, but it is not yet globally available. In this review, we will discuss the molecular virology of HEV, mode of transmission in industrialized countries, and potential implications for different specific patient populations.\",\"Interferon-free treatment options are rapidly evolving for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b (GT1b) infection with cirrhosis and for nonresponders to prior pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy. We performed a phase 2b, open-label trial of the combination of ombitasvir (a NS5A replication complex inhibitor), paritaprevir, and ritonavir (an NS3/4A protease inhibitor)-an interferon- and ribavirin-free regimen-in difficult-to-treat patients, including prior null responders and patients with cirrhosis.\",\"The objective of this systematic review was to summarize evidence regarding hepatitis C in hepatitis C virus/human immunodeficiency virus (HCV/HIV)-co-infected children focusing on mother-to-child transmission, clinical and laboratory features, outcome, and therapies.\",\"Persons with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1a (GT1a) infections harboring a baseline Q80K polymorphism in nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) have a reduced virologic response to simeprevir in combination with pegylated interferon-alfa and ribavirin. We aimed to develop, validate, and freely disseminate an NS3 clinical sequencing assay to detect the Q80K polymorphism and potentially other HCV NS3 drug resistance mutations. HCV RNA was extracted from frozen plasma using a NucliSENS easyMAG automated nucleic acid extractor, amplified by nested reverse transcription-PCR, and sequenced using Sanger and/or next-generation (MiSeq) methods. Sanger chromatograms were analyzed using in-house software (RECall), and nucleotide mixtures were called automatically. MiSeq reads were iteratively mapped to the H77 reference genome, and consensus NS3 sequences were generated with nucleotides present at >20% called as mixtures. The accuracy, precision, and sensitivity for detecting the Q80K polymorphism were assessed in 70 samples previously sequenced by an external laboratory. A comparison of the sequences generated by the Sanger and MiSeq methods with those determined by an external lab revealed >98.5% nucleotide sequence concordance and zero discordant calls of the Q80K polymorphism. The results were both highly repeatable and reproducible (>99.7% nucleotide concordance and 100% Q80K concordance). The limits of detection (>2 and \\u223c5 log10 IU/ml for the Sanger and MiSeq assays, respectively) are sufficiently low to allow genotyping in nearly all chronically infected treatment-naive persons. No systematic bias in the under- or overamplification of minority variants was observed. Coinfection with other viruses (e.g., HIV and hepatitis B virus [HBV]) did not affect the assay results. The two independent HCV NS3 sequencing assays with the automated analysis procedures described here are useful tools to screen for the Q80K polymorphism and other HCV protease inhibitor drug resistance mutations.\",\"Alisporivir is a cyclophilin inhibitor with pan-genotypic anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity and a high barrier to viral resistance. The VITAL-1 study assessed alisporivir as interferon (IFN)-free therapy in treatment-na\\u00efve patients infected with HCV genotype 2 or 3. Three hundred forty patients without cirrhosis were randomized to: arm 1, alisporivir (ALV) 1,000 mg once-daily (QD); arm 2, ALV 600 mg QD and ribavirin (RBV); arm 3, ALV 800 mg QD and RBV; arm 4, ALV 600 mg QD and pegylated IFN (Peg-IFN); or arm 5, Peg-IFN and RBV. Patients receiving IFN-free ALV regimens who achieved rapid virological response (RVR) continued the same treatment throughout, whereas those with detectable HCV RNA at week 4 received ALV, RBV, and Peg-IFN from weeks 6 to 24. Overall, 300 patients received ALV-based regimens. In arm 1 to arm 4, the intent-to-treat rates of sustained virological response (SVR) 24 weeks after treatment (SVR24) were from 80% to 85%, compared with 58% (n = 23 of 40) with Peg-IFN/RBV. Per-protocol analysis showed higher SVR24 rates in patients who received ALV/RBV, IFN-free after RVR (92%; n = 56 of 61) than with ALV alone after RVR (72%; n = 13 of 18) or with Peg-IFN/RBV (70%; n = 23 of 33). Both RVRs and SVRs to ALV IFN-free regimens were numerically higher in genotype 3- than in genotype 2-infected patients. Viral breakthrough was infrequent (3%; n = 7 of 258). IFN-free ALV treatment showed markedly better safety/tolerability than IFN-containing regimens.\",\"The strong impact of interleukin 28B (IL28B) polymorphisms on sustained virological response (SVR) after peginterferon and ribavirin treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is well-known. We investigated IL28B variability and hepatic expression of IP10, IFI27, ISG15, and MX1 in CHC patients, the relation of each with their clinical characteristics, and how they associated with responses to combined therapy. Genotyping and gene expression analysis were conducted in a selected cohort of treatment-na\\u00efve patients who underwent interferon and ribavirin treatment. Differential expression of IP10, IFI27, ISG15, and MX1 genes was assessed from pretreatment liver biopsies using quantitative PCR. Histopathological evaluation of liver specimens was performed on the basis of the Scheuer's modified scale. We showed that hepatic IFI27, ISG15, and MX1 expression was lower in the IL28B CC 12979860 and TT rs8099917 groups than in the CT-TT rs12979860 and TG-GG rs8099917 groups (P < 0.001). We found no differences in IP10 expression between the IL28B genotypes (P > 0.05); in contrast, IP10 expression was significantly affected by the progression of fibrosis (P = 0.007). We showed that the rs12979860 CC genotype was associated with successful treatment when compared to the rs12979860 CT-TT genotype (P = 0.004). Additionally, the expression levels of IP10, IFI27 and ISG15, but not MX1, were significantly higher in non-SVR patients than in SVR patients. The effect of variation in IL28B on the results of IFN-based treatment may be associated with changes in IFI27 and ISG15, but not with IP10. Silencing of IP10 is positive and independent from IL28B prediction of SVR, which is strongly associated with liver fibrosis in CHC patients.\",\"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes severe and often persistent arthritis. In recent years, millions of people have been infected with this virus for which registered antivirals are still lacking. Using our recently established in vitro assay, we discovered that the approved anti-parasitic drug suramin inhibits CHIKV RNA synthesis (IC50 of \\u223c5\\u03bcM). The compound inhibited replication of various CHIKV isolates in cell culture with an EC50 of \\u223c80\\u03bcM (CC50>5mM) and was also active against Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus. In vitro studies hinted that suramin interferes with (re)initiation of RNA synthesis, whereas time-of-addition studies suggested it to also interfere with a post-attachment early step in infection, possibly entry. CHIKV (nsP4) mutants resistant against favipiravir or ribavirin, which target the viral RNA polymerase, did not exhibit cross-resistance to suramin, suggesting a different mode of action. The assessment of the activity of a variety of suramin-related compounds in cell culture and the in vitro assay for RNA synthesis provided more insight into the moieties required for antiviral activity. The antiviral effect of suramin-containing liposomes was also analyzed. Its approved status makes it worthwhile to explore the use of suramin to prevent and/or treat CHIKV infections.\",\"AVIATOR, a phase 2 clinical trial, evaluated ritonavir-boosted paritaprevir (a protease inhibitor), ombitasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), and dasabuvir (a nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitor) (the three-drug [3D] regimen) with or without ribavirin (RBV) for 8, 12, or 24 weeks in 406 HCV genotype 1 (GT1)-infected patients. The rate of sustained virologic response 24 weeks after treatment ranged from 88% to 100% across the arms of the 3D regimen with or without RBV; 20 GT1a-infected patients and 1 GT1b-infected patient experienced virologic failure (5.2%). Baseline resistance-conferring variants in NS3 were rare. M28V in GT1a and Y93H in GT1b were the most prevalent preexisting variants in NS5A, and C316N in GT1b and S556G in both GT1a and GT1b were the most prevalent variants in NS5B. Interestingly, all the GT1a sequences encoding M28V in NS5A were from the United States, while GT1b sequences encoding C316N and S556G in NS5B were predominant in the European Union. Variants preexisting at baseline had no significant impact on treatment outcome. The most prevalent treatment-emergent resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in GT1a were R155K and D168V in NS3, M28T and Q30R in NS5A, and S556G in NS5B. The single GT1b-infected patient experiencing virologic failure had no RAVs in any target. A paritaprevir-ritonavir dose of 150/100 mg was more efficacious in suppressing R155K in NS3 than a 100/100-mg dose. In patients who failed after receiving 12 or more weeks of treatment, RAVs were selected in all 3 targets, while most patients who relapsed after 8 weeks of treatment did so without any detectable RAVs. Results from this study guided the selection of the optimal treatment regimen, treatment duration, and paritaprevir dose for further development of the 3D regimen. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT01464827.).\",\"Since 2011, treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) includes direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in addition to pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 (peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). IFN-based treatment induces strong cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity directed to the protease- and polymerase-derived epitopes. This enhanced immunological pressure could favour the emergence of viral epitope variants able to evade immune surveillance and, when resistance-associated variants (RAVs) are implicated, could also be co-selected as a hitchhiking effect. This study analysed the dynamics of the frequency of protease and polymerase inhibitor RAVs that could affect future HCV treatment in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infected patients on stable antiretroviral therapy with previous IFN-based treatment failure. HCV genotype 1a RNA was extracted from plasma samples of 18 patients prior to and during (24h and 4, 12, 24 and 48 weeks) therapy with peg-IFN+RBV. Next-generation sequencing was performed on HCV-RNA populations using NS3 and NS5B PCR-amplified coding regions. Two measures of genetic diversity were used to compare virus populations: average pairwise nucleotide diversity (\\u03c0) and Tajima's D statistic. Several protease and polymerase RAVs were detected in all subjects at very low frequencies (<5%), and in most cases their presence was not constant during follow-up. Only samples from two patients for each region exhibited Q80R/K/L and A421V as highly predominant variants. No significant differences were observed among sampling times for either \\u03c0 or D values. In conclusion, previous therapy and failure of peg-IFN+RBV were not associated with an increase in DAA-targeting NS3 or NS5B RAVs that naturally exist in HIV co-infected subjects.\",\"An estimated 184 million people worldwide have hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Chronic infection can ultimately result in liver cirrhosis and hepatic failure. Eradication of the virus by antiviral treatment can hinder the development of the aforementioned complications. Historically, the combination therapy of PEGylated interferon/ribavirin was considered the standard-of-care therapy for HCV. Such therapy did not demonstrate satisfactory cure rates and had significant side effects that precluded its widespread use among HCV patients. In view of this situation, scientific advances have led to the development of new interferon-free regimens that are better tolerated, more effective and with shorter duration of therapy. One of the newest members of this family is the all-oral regimen (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir co-packaged with dasabuvir) that has recently received FDA approval for the treatment of adult patients with genotype 1 HCV infection, including those with compensated cirrhosis. This new combination was found to be safe and well tolerated with high rates of sustained virologic response of up to 100%. An overview of the current knowledge about this regimen is reviewed herein.\",\"The treatment environment for chronic hepatitis C has undergone a revolution, particularly in genotype 1. Gone are interferon-based therapy and its associated tolerability challenges, inadequate response rates and numerous baseline factors that affect response to therapy. New and emerging treatment regimens employ all-oral combinations of direct-acting antiviral agents, and results of clinical trials suggest that these regimens routinely achieve cure rates >90%, even in patients who failed prior interferon-based triple therapy. In 2015, three all-oral FDA-approved regiments will be available for genotype 1 (sofosbuvir /ledipasvir, sofosbuvir/simeprevir, and paritaprevir/r/ombitasvir/dasabuvir). Furthermore, new treatment combinations appear to be more tolerable and require shorter duration of therapy. We provide an overview of the classes of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), the clinical factors affecting their integration into combination therapies and recent findings from trials of such combination therapies in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection.\",\"A number of statins, the cholesterol-lowering drugs, inhibit the in vitro replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV). In HCV-infected patients, addition of statins to the earlier standard of care therapy (pegIFN-\\u03b1 and ribavirin) resulted in increased sustained virological response rates. The mechanism by which statins inhibit HCV replication has not yet been elucidated. In an attempt to gain insight in the underlying mechanism, hepatoma cells carrying an HCV replicon were passaged in the presence of increasing concentrations of fluvastatin. Fluvastatin-resistant replicon containing cells could be generated and proved \\u223c8-fold less susceptible to fluvastatin than wild-type cultures. The growth efficiency of the resistant replicon containing cells was comparable to that of wild-type replicon cells. The fluvastatin-resistant phenotype was not conferred by mutations in the viral genome but is caused by cellular changes. The resistant cell line had a markedly increased HMG-CoA reductase expression upon statin treatment. Furthermore, the expression of the efflux transporter P-gp was increased in fluvastatin-resistant replicon cells (determined by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry). This increased expression resulted also in an increased functional transport activity as measured by the P-gp mediated efflux of calcein AM. In conclusion, we demonstrate that statin resistance in HCV replicon containing hepatoma cells is conferred by changes in the cellular environment.\",\"The role of interleukin (IL) 28B in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) has recently been examined in many studies, while a possible relationship between IL28B and the presence of mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) remains to be clarified. In this study, we analyzed the influence of IL28B rs8099917/rs12979860 on the presence of MC and the role in treatment with PEG-IFN. We retrospectively examined 541 patients affected by CHC who were treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin from 2003 to 2012. We included all treatment-na\\u00efve patients without other viral co-infections or major contraindications to the PEG-IFN and ribavirin standard of care. One hundred seventy-five patients (32.3 %) had MC; 49 of these (33.3 %) had symptomatic MC. The IL28B rs8099917/rs12979860 TT/CC genotype was the most frequent in MC-positive patients with sustained virological response (SVR) (p < 0.001), while the TG/TC genotype was most frequent in non-SVR (p < 0.001). The TT/CC genotype was found to be the main positive predictive factor of MC in HCV patients (OR = 11.914; IQR = 7.092-18.776; p < 0.001); HCV genotype 2/3 was the strongest positive predictive factor of SVR (OR = 10.448; IQR = 8.352-21.561; p < 0.001); IL28B rs8099917/rs12979860 TT/CC was a better predictive factor than rs12979860 CC alone (OR = 9.829 vs. 2.663). Negative predictive factors were Metavir score F3-F4 (OR = 0.625; IQR = 0.416-0.779; p = 0.008), insulin-resistance (OR = 0.315; IQR = 0.224-0.585; p < 0.001) and presence of symptoms (OR = 0.716; IQR = 0.492-0.855; p < 0.001). IL28B rs8099917/rs12979860 is useful in the treatment of MC-positive HCV patients with PEG-IFN and ribavirin; the TT/CC genotype is associated with SVR, the TG/TC with non-SVR; TT/CC is also predictive of MC in HCV patients.\",\"A fixed-dose tablet comprising ombitasvir (an NS5A replication complex inhibitor), paritaprevir (an NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and ritonavir (a cytochrome P450 inhibitor) taken in combination with dasabuvir (an NS5B polymerase inhibitor) is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection in several countries, including the USA (copackaged as Viekira Pak(\\u2122)) and those of the EU (Viekirax(\\u00ae) and Exviera(\\u00ae)). In phase II and III trials, this interferon-free regimen, taken \\u00b1 ribavirin, provided high rates of sustained virological response 12 weeks post-treatment in adults with chronic HCV genotype 1a or 1b infection, including those with compensated cirrhosis, liver transplants or HIV-1 co-infection. The regimen was generally well tolerated, with nausea, insomnia, asthenia, pruritus, other skin reactions and fatigue being among the most common tolerability issues. Thus, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir is an effective interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral regimen for use \\u00b1 ribavirin in a broad range of adults chronically infected with HCV genotype 1.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can cause liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several studies have demonstrated that the eradication of HCV reduces the occurrence of HCC. In Japan, as many people live to an advanced age, HCV-infected patients are also getting older, and the age at HCC diagnosis has also increased. Although older HCV-infected patients have a risk of developing HCC, the treatment response to peginterferon-alpha plus ribavirin therapy is relatively poor in these patients because of drop-out or discontinuation of this treatment due to adverse events. It is established that the mechanism of action between interferon-alpha and interferon-beta is slightly different. Short-term natural interferon-beta monotherapy is effective for patients with acute hepatitis C and patients infected with HCV genotype 2 and low viral loads. Natural interferon-beta plus ribavirin for 48 wk or for 24 wk are also effective for some patients with HCV genotype 1 or HCV genotype 2. Natural interferon-beta plus ribavirin has been used for certain \\\"difficult-to-treat\\\" HCV-infected patients. In the era of direct-acting anti-virals, natural interferon-beta plus ribavirin may be one of the therapeutic options for special groups of HCV-infected patients. In the near future, signal transduction pathways of interferon-beta will inform further directions.\",\"More than twenty years of study has provided a better understanding of hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle, including the general properties of viral RNA and proteins. This effort facilitates the development of sensitive diagnostic tools and effective antiviral treatments. At present, serologic screening test is recommended to perform on individuals in the high risk groups and nucleic acid tests are recommended to confirm the active HCV infections. Quantization and genotyping of HCV RNAs are important to determine the optimal duration of anti-viral therapy and predict the likelihood of response. In the early 2000s, pegylated interferon plus ribavirin became the standard anti-HCV treatment. However, this therapy is not ideal. To 2014, boceprevir, telaprevir, simeprevir, sofosbuvir and Harvoni are approved by Food and Drug Administration for the treat of HCV infections. It is likely that the new all-oral, interferon-free, pan-genotyping anti-HCV therapy will be available within the next few years. Majority of HCV infections will be cured by these anti-viral treatments. However, not all patients are expected to be cured due to viral resistance and the high cost of antiviral treatments. Thus, an efficient prophylactic vaccine will be the next challenge in the fight against HCV infection.\",\"Anno 2015, the race for developing the ideal therapy, or what is now called \\\"cure,\\\" for hepatitis C virus infection has continued unabatedly. The targets (NS3/4A protease, NS5A protein, and NS5B polymerase) have remained the same, and the number of compounds [direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)] interacting with these targets has continued to increase. Whereas pan-genotypic activity has remained a mandatory requirement, the problem of virus drug resistance has become less crucial. The need for combining DAAs acting at different sites has remained compelling, with the drugs used for combinations emanating from the same pharmaceutical company, that is, Gilead (sofosbuvir and ledipasvir) (Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA) (AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA), AbbVie (ABT/r, ombitasvir, and dasabuvir), and BMS (Bristol-Myers Squibb), (New York City, NY, USA) (asunaprevir and daclatasvir) among the leading contenders. At stake is the definitive cure of HCV infection [as reflected by a sustained viral response (SVR) after 12 weeks of treatment]. This SVR is expected to reduce cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, two complications inherently linked to HCV infection. Unlike hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus, HCV infection can be definitely and permanently cured by antiviral therapy because HCV has no long-term reservoir in the body. Peginterferon combined with ribavirin and even the first-wave protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir now belong to the milestones that had an important, although historical, role in the final conquest of hepatitis C.\",\"This study describes the discovery of novel dengue virus inhibitors targeting both a crucial viral protein-protein interaction and an essential host cell factor as a strategy to reduce the emergence of drug resistance. Starting from known c-Src inhibitors, a virtual screening was performed to identify molecules able to interact with a recently discovered allosteric pocket on the dengue virus NS5 polymerase. The selection of cheap-to-produce scaffolds and the exploration of the biologically relevant chemical space around them suggested promising candidates for chemical synthesis. A series of purines emerged as the most interesting candidates able to inhibit virus replication at low micromolar concentrations with no significant toxicity to the host cell. Among the identified antivirals, compound 16i proved to be 10 times more potent than ribavirin, showed a better selectivity index and represents the first-in-class DENV-NS5 allosteric inhibitor able to target both the virus NS5-NS3 interaction and the host kinases c-Src/Fyn.\",\"The treatment of chronic hepatitis C has developed significantly during the last 25 years. In patients with genotype 1 infection 40-50% sustained virologic response could be achieved using pegylated interferon and ribavirin dual combination, which could be increased significantly with the introduction of direct acting antivirals. Three major groups of direct acting antivirals are known, which directly inhibit different phases of viral life cycle, by inhibiting the function of several non-structural proteins (NS3/4A protease, NS5A protein and NS5B polymerase). Due to the rapid replication rate of hepatitis C virus and the error-prone NS5B polymerase activity, mutant virions are generated, which might have reduced susceptibility to direct acting antiviral therapy. Since these resistance associated variants might exist before the antiviral therapy, they are still able to replicate during the direct acting antiviral treatment. Due to this selection pressure, the resistant virus will replace the wild type. This was especially detected during monotherapy, therefore, the first generation of direct acting antivirals have been combined with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, while recently interferon-free combinations are being developed including 2 or 3 direct acting antivirals. Using the first generation protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir, it could have been seen, that the rate of resistance associated variants is higher and the therapeutic outcome is worse in patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 1a, than in 1b. Similar phenomenon was seen with the second generation of NS3/4A protease inhibitors as well as with NS5A or NS5B polymerase. This is due to the lower genetic barrier to resistance, ie. usually fewer mutations are enough for the emergence of resistance in genotype 1a. The selection of resistance associated variants is one of the most important challenges during the interferon-free therapy.\",\"Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are the only available licensed therapeutics against human H7N9 influenza virus infections. The emergence of NAI-resistant variants of H7N9viruses with an NA R292K mutation poses a therapeutic challenge. A comprehensive understanding of the susceptibility of these viruses to clinically available NAIs, non-NAIs and their combinations is crucial for effective treatment. In this study, by using limited serial passage and plaque purification, an R292K variant of the Anhui1 lineage was isolated from a patient with clinical evidence of resistance to oseltamivir. In vitro and cell-based assays confirmed a high level of resistance conferred by the R292K mutation to oseltamivir carboxylate and a moderate level of resistance to zanamivir and peramivir. Non-NAI antivirals, such as T-705, ribavirin and NT-300, efficiently inhibited both the variant and the wild-type in cell-based assays. A combination of NAIs and non-NAIs did not exhibit a marked synergistic effect against the R292K variant. However, the combination of two non-NAIs (T-705 and ribavirin) exhibited significant synergism against the mutant virus. In experimentally infected mice, the variant showed delayed onset of symptoms, a reduced viral load and attenuated lethality compared with the wild-type. Our study suggested non-NAIs should be tested clinically for H7N9 patients with a sustained high viral load. Possible drug combination regimens, such as T-705 plus ribavirin, should be further tested in animal models. The pathogenicity and transmissibility of the R292K H7N9 variant should be further assessed with genetically well-characterized pairs of viruses and, most-desirably, with competitive fitness experiments.\",\"Tegobuvir (GS-9190) is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of HCV RNA replication with proven antiviral activity in HCV-infected patients. The in vitro antiviral activity of Tegobuvir, when combined with one or two other direct acting antivirals (DAA) was assessed. When Tegobuvir was combined with either interferon \\u03b1-2b, ribavirin, the protease inhibitor (PI) VX-950, the nucleoside polymerase inhibitor (NI) 2'-C-methylcytidine or various non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors, an overall additive antiviral activity was observed. Adding Tegobuvir (at concentrations of 6, 30 or 150nM) to replicon-containing cells in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of the PI or of the various polymerase inhibitors either markedly delayed or completely prevented resistance development against these latter compounds. Tegobuvir (15nM), when combined with the PI, was able to cure replicon-containing cells from their replicon after a single passage, whereas either compound alone (at 2-fold higher concentration) was not. The triple combination of Tegobuvir (10nM), the PI and the NI resulted in clearance of replicon RNA after only two passages. In contrast, the inhibitors when used alone at 3-fold higher concentrations were not able to cure the cells from the replicon, after as long as 6 passages. Combinations containing low concentrations of Tegobuvir are thus highly effective in curing cells from HCV replicon and in delaying or preventing the development of resistance against other DAA.\",\"Antiviral medication is used for the treatment of severe influenza infections, of which the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are the most effective drugs, approved so far. Here, we investigated the antiviral efficacy of the peptidomimetic furin inhibitor MI-701 in combination with oseltamivir carboxylate and ribavirin against the infection of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) that are activated by the host protease furin. Cell cultures infected with the strains A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004 (H5N1) and A/FPV/Rostock/1934 (H7N1) were treated with each agent alone, or in double and triple combinations. MI-701 alone achieved a concentration-dependent reduction of virus propagation. Double treatment of MI-701 with oseltamivir carboxylate and triple combination with ribavirin showed synergistic inhibition and a pronounced delay of virus propagation. MI-701 resistant mutants were not observed. Emergence of NA mutation H275Y conferring high oseltamivir resistance was significantly delayed in the presence of MI-701. Our data indicate that combination with a potent furin inhibitor significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy of conventional antivirals drugs against HPAIV infection.\",\"A series of 2-pyridinyl-3-substituted-4(3H)-quinazolinones were synthesized, and their anti-influenza A virus activities were determined using the cytopathic effect inhibition assay. Most of the compounds were potent with IC50 values ranging from 51.6 to 93.0 \\u03bcm, which are better than that of the currently marketed drug ribavirin. The molecular mechanisms of the new compounds were investigated using neuraminidase inhibition assay, cellular NF-\\u03baB signaling pathway inhibition assay, and computational docking. Compound 4e, which is a N3 imidazol-1-ylpropyl-substituted derivative of 2-pyridinyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone, had the most potent anti-influenza A virus activity in vitro, and inhibited both virus neuraminidase and cellular NF-\\u03baB signaling pathway. In conclusion, 2-pyridinyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone is a new scaffold for the design of potent anti-influenza A virus compounds, offering an alternative approach to tackle influenza drug resistance.\",\"Recurrent hepatitis C infection after liver transplantation (LT) is associated with lower rates of graft and patient survival.\",\"The availability of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy has launched a new era in the management of chronic hepatitis C. Sofosbuvir, a uridine nucleotide analog that inhibits the hepatitis C RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is the backbone of chronic hepatitis C therapy. Acting at the catalytic site of the polymerase, sofosbuvir is highly potent in suppressing viral replication and has a high genetic barrier to resistance. Sofosbuvir is effective across all hepatitis C genotypes, and is a mainstay of interferon-free combination therapy. In Phase II and III studies, genotype 1 patients who took sofosbuvir in combination with another DAA such as the NS3-4A protease inhibitor, simeprevir, or the NS5A replication complex inhibitors, ledipasvir or daclatasvir, achieved a sustained virologic response rate of over 90%. Harvoni(\\u00ae), a combination tablet of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, dosed once daily is recommended for 24 weeks for treatment-experienced genotype 1 patients with cirrhosis, but 12 weeks of therapy is sufficient for all other populations. While genotype 2 (12 weeks or 16 weeks) and treatment-na\\u00efve genotype 3 patients (24 weeks) have excellent response rates with sofosbuvir and ribavirin, treatment-experienced cirrhotic genotype 3 patients may need the addition of another DAA such as daclatasvir. Sofosbuvir is efficacious in special populations such as HIV-hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients and liver transplant recipients and has already made a profound impact in these groups. Since it is renally eliminated, patients with advanced kidney disease or on dialysis must await dosing recommendations. Sofosbuvir-based regimens appear to be well tolerated with headache and fatigue being the most common side effects. The opportunity to cure patients with hepatitis C with sofosbuvir combination therapy is likely to change the future for our patients, particularly if the emphasis shifts to identifying those patients unaware that they are infected and providing affordable access to treatment.\",\"An influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection was diagnosed in a hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient during conditioning regimen. He was treated with oral oseltamivir, later combined with intravenous zanamivir. The H275Y neuraminidase (NA) mutation was first detected, and an E119D NA mutation was identified during zanamivir therapy.\",\"Although cirrhosis has long been recognized as an important negative predictor of treatment response for hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy, the mechanisms underlying this association remain relatively poorly understood. Treatment has progressed rapidly with the introduction of highly effective all-oral therapies, with promising outcomes even in patients with advanced cirrhosis. However, even with the new therapies, it is clear that patients with cirrhosis require special attention. Efficacy continues to be somewhat reduced compared to non-cirrhotic patients and safety is an important concern. In this review, we explore the reasons for treatment non-response in patients with cirrhosis. We focus on how cirrhosis impacts on four important areas including drug delivery, drug uptake and metabolism, immune responses and drug toxicity with examples from the clinical and basic literature. Fortunately, as treatment continues to progress, many of the challenges of treating patients with cirrhosis will become less and less problematic.\",\"The pretherapeutic presence of protease inhibitor (PI) resistance-associated variants (RAVs) has not been shown to be predictive of triple-therapy outcomes in treatment-naive patients. However, they may influence the outcome in patients with less effective pegylated interferon (pegIFN)-ribavirin (RBV) backbones. Using hepatitis C virus (HCV) population sequence analysis, we retrospectively investigated the prevalence of baseline nonstructural 3 (NS3) RAVs in a multicenter cohort of poor IFN-RBV responders (i.e., prior null responders or patients with a viral load decrease of <1 log IU/ml during the pegIFN-RBV lead-in phase). The impact of the presence of these RAVs on the outcome of triple therapy was studied. Among 282 patients, the prevalances (95% confidence intervals) of baseline RAVs ranged from 5.7% (3.3% to 9.0%) to 22.0% (17.3% to 27.3%), depending to the algorithm used. Among mutations conferring a >3-fold shift in 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for telaprevir or boceprevir, T54S was the most frequently detected mutation (3.9%), followed by A156T, R155K (0.7%), V36M, and V55A (0.35%). Mutations were more frequently found in patients infected with genotype 1a (7.5 to 23.6%) than 1b (3.3 to 19.8%) (P = 0.03). No other sociodemographic or viroclinical characteristic was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of RAVs. No obvious effect of baseline RAVs on viral load was observed. In this cohort of poor responders to IFN-RBV, no link was found with a sustained virological response to triple therapy, regardless of the algorithm used for the detection of mutations. Based on a cross-study comparison, baseline RAVs are not more frequent in poor IFN-RBV responders than in treatment-naive patients and, even in these difficult-to-treat patients, this study demonstrates no impact on treatment outcome, arguing against resistance analysis prior to treatment.\",\"The HCV NS3/4A serine protease inhibitors (PIs) boceprevir (BOC), telaprevir (TVR) and simeprevir (SMV) are approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. The present study investigated the prevalence of HCV NS3 drug resistance mutations (DRMs) associated with HCV genotype-1-infected individuals at baseline and in viral breakthrough following BOC and TVR treatment.\",\"Although modified live virus (MLV) vaccines are commonly used for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) control, there have been safety concerns due to the quick reversion of MLV to virulence during replication in pigs. Previous studies have demonstrated that mutant viruses emerged from lethal mutagenesis driven by antiviral mutagens and that those viruses had higher genetic stability compared to their parental strains because they acquired resistance to random mutation. Thus, this strategy was explored to stabilize the PRRSV genome in the current study.\",\"A series of novel isoflavonoids were synthesized based on structural modifications of daidzein, an active ingredient of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and evaluated for their anti-influenza activity, in vitro, against H1N1 Tamiflu-resistant (H1N1 TR) virus in the MDCK cell line. Among them, 4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-8-carbaldehydes 11a-11g were most promising, and they demonstrated better activities and selectivities comparable to those the reference ribarivin, a nucleoside antiviral agent. 3-(4-Bromophenyl)-7-hydroxy-4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-8-carboxaldehyde (11c) displayed the best inhibitory activity (EC50 , 29.0 \\u03bcM) and selectivity index (SI>10.3). Analysis of the structure(?)activity relationships (SAR) indicated that both the non-naturally-occurring Br-substituted B-ring and appropriate CHO and OH groups on the A-ring might be critical for the activity and selectivity against H1N1 TR influenza viruses.\",\"Daclatasvir (DCV) is an approved NS5A inhibitor with potent anti-HCV activity and broad genotype coverage. DCV resistance-associated variants (RAVs) have been described for patients infected with genotype (GT) 1, but increased GT4 prevalence in European countries as a result of immigration has boosted interest in this genotype.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects an estimated 185 million people worldwide, with chronic infection often leading to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although HCV is curable, there is an unmet need for the development of effective and affordable treatment options. Through a cell-based high-throughput screen, we identified chlorcyclizine HCl (CCZ), an over-the-counter drug for allergy symptoms, as a potent inhibitor of HCV infection. CCZ inhibited HCV infection in human hepatoma cells and primary human hepatocytes. The mode of action of CCZ is mediated by inhibiting an early stage of HCV infection, probably targeting viral entry into host cells. The in vitro antiviral effect of CCZ was synergistic with other anti-HCV drugs, including ribavirin, interferon-\\u03b1, telaprevir, boceprevir, sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, and cyclosporin A, without significant cytotoxicity, suggesting its potential in combination therapy of hepatitis C. In the mouse pharmacokinetic model, CCZ showed preferential liver distribution. In chimeric mice engrafted with primary human hepatocytes, CCZ significantly inhibited infection of HCV genotypes 1b and 2a, without evidence of emergence of drug resistance, during 4 and 6 weeks of treatment, respectively. With its established clinical safety profile as an allergy medication, affordability, and a simple chemical structure for optimization, CCZ represents a promising candidate for drug repurposing and further development as an effective and accessible agent for treatment of HCV infection.\",\"To determine the association between rapid viral response and IL28B, IL28RA, IL10RB and MxA polymorphisms in the Chinese Han population.\",\"Retreatment of patients who have not achieved sustained virological response (SVR) after treatment with investigational direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) has not been extensively studied. We conducted an open-label trial to assess the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir (SOF) plus pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) in patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) who participated in previous studies of one or more Gilead investigational DAAs in combination with RBV with or without Peg-IFN. We enrolled 80 patients at 40 sites. All patients received SOF 400 mg once daily plus Peg-IFN-\\u03b1 180 \\u03bcg/week and weight-based ribavirin (1,000 or 1,200 mg/day) for 12 weeks. The efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with SVR 12 weeks after discontinuation of therapy (SVR12). Of the 80 patients enrolled, 36 (45%) had received two or more courses of earlier treatment for HCV and 74 (93%) had at least one resistance-associated variant (RAV) at baseline. SVR12 was achieved by 63 of the 80 patients (79%) treated. Rates of SVR12 were similar across patient subgroups. Presence of RAVs at baseline did not appear to be associated with treatment failure. Seventy-one of eighty patients (89%) experienced at least one adverse event (AE), but most events were mild to moderate in severity. The most common AEs were fatigue, headache, and nausea. No patients discontinued all treatment because of AEs.\",\"Objective. To investigate the relationship between insulin resistance and viral load decay in nondiabetic and noncirrhotic genotype 1 chronic HCV patients during peginterferon and ribavirin treatment and the possible influence of BMI and leptin as metabolic confounders. Methods. 75 consecutive noncirrhotic, nonobese, and nondiabetic patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C treated with peginterferon alpha 2a plus ribavirin were evaluated. HOMA-IR, serum leptin, and BMI were measured in all patients at baseline and at weeks 12 and 48, whereas viral load was measured at the same time points and then 24 weeks after the end of treatment. Results. HOMA-IR was significantly associated with both BMI and leptin at baseline. During peginterferon plus ribavirin treatment, there was a significant reduction of HOMA-IR at weeks 12 and 48 from baseline (P = 0.033 and 0.048, resp.) in patients who achieved an early viral load decay (EVR), a trend not observed in patients who not achieved EVR. No variations during treatment were observed regarding BMI and leptin irrespective of EVR. Conclusion. The early reduction of HOMA-IR but not of BMI and leptin during antiviral treatment in noncirrhotic, chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 patients who achieved EVR suggests a viral genesis of insulin resistance in patients with nonmetabolic phenotype.\",\"Because of recent advances in deep sequencing technology, detailed analysis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) quasispecies and their dynamic changes in response to direct antiviral agents (DAAs) became possible, although the role of quasispecies is not fully understood. In this study, to clarify the evolution of viral quasispecies and the origin of drug-resistant mutations induced by interferon (IFN)-based protease inhibitor therapy, the nonstructural-3 (NS3) region of genotype 1b HCV in 34 chronic hepatitis patients treated with telaprevir (TVR)/pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin (RBV) was subjected to a deep sequencing study coupled with phylogenetic analysis. Twenty-six patients (76.5%) achieved a sustained viral response (SVR), while 8 patients did not (non-SVR; 23.5%). When the complexity of the quasispecies was expressed as the mutation frequency or Shannon entropy value, a significant decrease in the IFNL3 (rs8099917) TT group and a marginal decrease in the SVR group were found soon (12 h) after the introduction of treatment, whereas there was no decrease in the non-SVR group and no significant decrease in mutation frequency in the IFNL3 TG/GG group. In the analysis of viral quasispecies composition in non-SVR patients, major populations greatly changed, accompanied by the appearance of resistance, and the compositions were unlikely to return to the pretreatment composition even after the end of therapy. Clinically TVR-resistant variants were observed in 5 non-SVR patients (5/8, 62.5%), all of which were suspected to have acquired resistance by mutations through phylogenetic analysis. In conclusion, results of the study have important implications for treatment response and outcome in interferon-based protease inhibitor therapy.\",\"Drug resistance remains a major impediment in the development of durable cancer therapies. Studies in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients revealed a new form of multidrug resistance. Here, increased glioma-associated protein GLI1 leads to elevation of the UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) enzymes. UGTs add glucuronic acid to xenobiotics and metabolites. Traditionally, the loss of these enzymes is thought to contribute to cancer as a result of impaired clearance of environmental carcinogens. However, we demonstrate that overexpression of UGTs can contribute to oncogenesis by promoting drug resistance. Indeed, UGT levels in AML patients treated with ribavirin and/or cytarabine were elevated at relapse relative to diagnosis. This was reversed by GLI1 inhibition, suggesting a clinically relevant strategy to overcome drug resistance. Further, overexpression of UGTs can also lead to drug resistance in other cancers, such as certain Hsp90 inhibitors and vorinostat in colorectal and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively. Not all drugs are targets of glucuronidation, suggesting that UGT status could be relevant to treatment choice. Here, we describe several facets of UGT biology and how these could be exploited clinically. These studies demonstrate how drugs in cancer cells can be metabolized differentially than their normal counterparts. In summary, we describe a new form of drug resistance relevant to a variety of cancer contexts.\",\"Clinical phase II/III studies of the nucleotide analogue HCV NS5B inhibitor sofosbuvir (SOF) have demonstrated high efficacy in HCV-infected patients in combination therapy. To date, resistance to SOF (S282T in NS5B) has rarely been detected in patients. In this study, we investigated the evolution of S282T viral variants detected in one HCV genotype 2b-infected patient who relapsed following 12 weeks of SOF monotherapy. Deep sequencing of the NS5B gene was performed on longitudinal plasma samples at baseline, days 2 and 3 on SOF, and longitudinal samples post-SOF treatment through week 48. Intrapatient HCV evolution was analysed by maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis. Deep sequencing analysis revealed a low level pre-existence of S282T at 0.05% of viral sequences (4/7755 reads) at baseline and 0.03% (6/23 415 reads) at day 2 on SOF. Viral relapse was detected at week 4 post-treatment where 99.8% of the viral population harboured S282T. Follow-up analysis determined that S282T levels diminished post-treatment reaching undetectable levels 24-48 weeks post-SOF. Phylogenetic analysis together with the persistence of unique post-treatment mutations in all post-SOF samples suggested that growth of wild type resulted from reversion of the S282T mutant to a wild type and not outgrowth of the baseline wild-type population. Our data suggest that a very low level of pre-existing S282T at baseline in this patient was enriched and transiently detected following SOF monotherapy. Despite relapse with drug resistance to SOF, this patient was successfully retreated with SOF plus ribavirin for 12 weeks and is now cured from HCV infection.\",\"Great progress has been made in understanding the HCV genome and its molecular virology. This understanding has culminated in the development of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents targeting HCV viral proteins. Telaprevir (TVR) and boceprevir (BOC) were the first DAAs introduced for treatment of genotype 1 HCV in 2011; when used in combination with pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV), these protease inhibitors improved efficacy in patients with chronic HCV infection compared to the traditional dual therapy. However, this combination was associated with adverse events that often led to early termination of therapy. In late 2013, the FDA approved a second wave of DAAs, sofosbuvir (SOF) and simeprevir (SMV). The use of SOF with SMV opened the door for IFN-free combination regimens. This combination was highly efficacious and well tolerated in patients with HCV genotype 1. Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (LDV) fixed-dose oral combination (FDC) therapy, and paritaprevir/ritonavir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir \\u00b1 RBV were recently approved, elevating sustained virologic response (SVR) rates to over 95 %. We are anticipating the approval of additional IFN-free regimens with comparable efficacy and tolerability but with the addition of pangenotypic coverage, fewer drug-drug interactions, and a high barrier to resistance. This review will summarize current management for chronic HCV infection.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis and infects approximately three to four million people per year, about 170 million infected people in total, making it one of the major global health problems. In a minority of cases HCV is cleared spontaneously, but in most of the infected individuals infection progresses to a chronic state associated with high risk to develop liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer, or liver failure. The treatment of HCV infection has evolved over the years. Interferon (IFN)-\\u03b1 in combination with ribavirin has been used for decades as standard therapy. More recently, a new standard-of-care treatment has been approved based on a triple combination with either HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir or boceprevir. In addition, various options for all-oral, IFN-free regimens are currently being evaluated. Despite substantial improvement of sustained virological response rates, some intrinsic limitations of these new direct-acting antivirals, including serious side effects, the risk of resistance development and high cost, urge the development of alternative or additional therapeutic strategies. Gene therapy represents a feasible alternative treatment. Small RNA technology, including RNA interference (RNAi) techniques and antisense approaches, is one of the potentially promising ways to investigate viral and host cell factors that are involved in HCV infection and replication. With this, newly developed gene therapy regimens will be provided to treat HCV. In this chapter, a comprehensive overview guides you through the current developments and applications of RNAi and microRNA-based gene therapy strategies in HCV treatment.\",\"We analyzed the impact of pretreatment variants conferring boceprevir-resistance on sustained virologic response (SVR) rates achieved with boceprevir plus peginterferon-\\u03b1/ribavirin (P/R) for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-genotype-1 infection.\",\"Daclatasvir (Daklinza\\u00ae) is an inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein. It is a new, oral, direct-acting antiviral with potent pangenotypic activity. This article provides a narrative review of the efficacy and tolerability of daclatasvir in combination with other agents in the treatment of patients with chronic HCV infection and summarizes its pharmacological properties. Since daclatasvir has a different mechanism of action to other current direct-acting antivirals, it provides additive or synergistic antiviral activity when used in combination. It produces high sustained virological response rates when used in combination with peginterferon-\\u03b1 plus ribavirin in patients chronically infected with HCV genotypes 1-4, and provides even higher response rates when used in an interferon-free, all-oral combination with sofosbuvir, with or without ribavirin. Daclatasvir has a moderately high genetic barrier to resistance, is effective during short-term treatment over 12 weeks and has a tolerability profile similar to that of placebo. In conclusion, daclatasvir is a highly effective and well tolerated, oral, once-daily, direct-acting antiviral for use in combination therapy in adult patients chronically infected with HCV.\",\"There is an unmet need for interferon- and ribavirin-free treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\",\"HIV-1/HCV co-infection is a significant health problem. Highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) against HIV-1 has proved to be fairly successful. On the other hand, direct acting antiviral drugs against HCV have improved cure rates but high cost and development of drug resistance are important concerns. Therefore PEGylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) still remain essential components of HCV treatment, and identification of host factors that predict IFN/RBV treatment response is necessary for effective clinical management of HCV infection. Impaired dendritic cell (DC) and T cell responses are associated with HCV persistence. It has been shown that IFN/RBV treatment enhances HCV-specific T cell functions and it is likely that functional restoration of DCs is the underlying cause. To test this hypothesis, we utilized an antibody cocktail (consisting of DC maturation, adhesion and other surface markers) to perform comprehensive phenotypic characterization of myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in a cohort of HIV-1/HCV co-infected individuals undergoing IFN/RBV treatment. Our results show that pre-treatment frequencies of mDCs are lower in non-responders (NRs) compared to responders (SVRs) and healthy controls. Although, the treatment was able to restore the frequency of mDCs in NRs, it downregulated the frequency of CCR7[+], CD54[+] and CD62L[+] mDCs. Pre-treatment frequencies of pDCs were lower in NRs and decreased further upon treatment. Compared to SVRs, NRs exhibited higher ratio of PD-L1[+]/CD86[+] pDCs prior to treatment; and this ratio remained high even after treatment. These findings demonstrate that enumeration and phenotypic assessment of DCs before/during therapy can help predict the treatment outcome. We also show that before treatment, PBMCs from SVRs secrete higher amounts of IFN-\\u03b3 compared to controls and NRs. Upon genotyping IFNL3 polymorphisms rs12979860, rs4803217 and ss469415590, we found rs12979860 to be a better predictor of treatment outcome. Collectively, our study led to identification of important correlates of IFN/RBV treatment response in HIV-1/HCV co-infected individuals.\",\"Ribavirin (RBV) is a potential partner of interferon-based therapy and recently approved therapy using direct acting antivirals for patients with chronic hepatitis C. However, the precise mechanisms underlying RBV action against hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication are not yet understood. To clarify this point, we attempted to develop RBV-resistant cells from RBV-sensitive HCV RNA-replicating cells.\",\"Influenza is an important cause of annual epidemics of respiratory viral infection associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Three classes of drugs, the M2 ion channel, neuraminidase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, are approved for the prevention and treatment of influenza. Due to widespread resistance to the class, the M2 ion channel inhibitors are not recommended currently for therapy. The only polymerase inhibitor, favipiravir, is approved only in Japan and its use is highly restricted. Despite significant data to support the early use of the neuraminidase inhibitors, their use in all patient populations is suboptimal. The data to support the early use of neuraminidase inhibitors will be reviewed, as will current data on the utilization rates in ambulatory and hospitalized populations.\",\"The development of boceprevir and telaprevir was a major step forward in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. In addition, the treatment of these infections has been recently revolutionized by the approval of sofosbuvir and simeprevir. However, there are several challenges associated with the application of novel drugs, such as new and more frequent adverse events, new drug interactions, and excessively high treatment costs. An additional concern is viral resistance. These considerations highlight the fact that direct-acting antiviral agents are not a panacea and may not be the best option for all patients who are in need of therapy. This retrospective study revealed that the sustained virologic response was not significantly reduced following peginterferon and ribavirin retreatment compared with the new therapy. We suggest that patients who experience relapse shortly after completing treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin have a reasonable chance of achieving a sustained virologic response when retreated with these drugs alone.\",\"To use existing hepatitis C virus (HCV) antiviral therapies as access to new treatments is limited.\",\"To review the data with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection.\",\"Dual or triple combination regimens of novel hepatitis C direct-acting antivirals (DAA, daclatasvir, asunaprevir, or beclabuvir) provide high sustained virological response rates and reduced frequency of resistance compared to clinical monotherapy. To support pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments in clinical studies, a multiplexed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantitation of daclatasvir, asunaprevir, beclabuvir (BMS-791325) and its active metabolite (BMS-794712) in human plasma was developed and validated. Human plasma samples were extracted with methyl-t-butyl ether followed by an LC-MS/MS analysis, which was conducted in a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The lower limits of quantitation (LLOQ) were 1 ng/mL for daclatasvir, asunaprevir, and BMS-794712, and 2 ng/mL for beclabuvir. Intra-run precision (\\u22644.5% CV), inter-run precision (\\u22642.9% CV), and accuracy (\\u00b15.3% deviation) based on different concentration levels (low, geometric mean, mid and high) of the quality control samples (QCs) provided evidence of the methods accuracy and precision. Selectivity and matrix effect on LC-MS/MS detection, stability in plasma, and potential interference of coadministered drugs (ribavirin and interferon) were all evaluated and the results were acceptable. Method reproducibility was demonstrated by the reanalysis of a portion of study samples. The cross-validation results for QCs demonstrated the equivalency between this method and two single-analyte methods which were previously validated for quantitation of daclatasvir in human plasma. This approach of using a multiplexed LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantitation of three DAAs is time- and cost-effective, and can maintain good data quality in sample analysis.\",\"Treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has revolutionized the care of infected patients. Among these novel compounds are non-nucleoside analogs, which bind viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase resulting in a conformational change inhibiting RNA synthesis.\",\"Ribavirin is phosphorylated by adenosine kinase 1 (AK1) and cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 2 and it is transported into cells by concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNT) 2/3, coded by SLC28A2/3 genes, and equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT) 1/2, coded by SLC29A1/2 genes. We evaluated the association of some polymorphisms of IL28B, SLC28A2/3, SLC29A1, ABCB1, NT5C2, AK1, HNF4\\u03b1 genes and ribavirin treatment outcome and pharmacokinetics after 4weeks of therapy, in a cohort of HCV-1/4 Italian patients. Allelic discrimination was performed by real-time PCR; plasma concentrations were determined at the end of dosing interval (Ctrough) using an HPLC-UV method. Non response was negatively predicted by cryoglobulinemia and IL28B_rs12980275 AA genotype and positively by Metavir score; Metavir score, insulin resistance and SLC28A2_rs1060896 CA/AA and HNF4\\u03b1_rs1884613 CC genotypes were negative predictive factors of SVR, whereas HCV viral load at baseline and IL28B_rs12980275 AA and rs8099917 TT genotypes positively predicted this outcome; RVR was negatively predicted by insulin resistance and positively by cryoglobulinemia and IL28B_rs12980275 AA genotype; Metavir score and insulin resistance were able to negatively predict EVR, whereas cryoglobulinemia and IL28B_rs12980275 AA genotype positively predicted it; at last, virological relapse was negatively predicted by IL28B_rs8099917 TT and AK1_rs1109374 TT genotypes, insulin resistance was a positive predictor factor. Concerning ribavirin pharmacokinetics, SLC28A2_rs11854488 TT was related to lower Ctrough levels; conversely patients with TC profile of SLC28A3_rs10868138 and SLC29A1_rs760370 GG genotype had higher ribavirin levels. These results might contribute to the clarification of mechanisms causing the individuality in the response to ribavirin containing therapy.\",\"Although interferon-free regimens are approved for patients co-infected with HIV and genotype-2 or genotype-3 hepatitis C virus (HCV), interferon-based regimens are still an option for those co-infected with HIV and HCV genotypes 1 or 4. These regimens are limited by clinically significant toxic effects and drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of an interferon-free, all-oral regimen of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin in patients with HIV and HCV co-infection.\",\"In a prospective cohort of 18 patients treated with boceprevir, we examined the role of boceprevir plasma concentration at the onset of breakthrough during the treatment. Nine patients experienced breakthrough during therapy. The resistance patterns were as follows: S122S/R, I132V, T54A/I132V, V156S/I170A, V36M/T54S/R155K, V36M/R155K and T54/R155K. Boceprevir-S isomer (SCH 534128) median concentration in patients with breakthrough was 48.3 ng/mL (interquartile range 43-58 ng/mL); in others, it was significantly (p 0.019) higher: 151 ng/mL. Low boceprevir plasma concentration can lead to virologic resistance; therapeutic drug monitoring should be used to prevent the onset of viral breakthrough during triple-regimen therapy with boceprevir.\",\"To describe chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, including its epidemiology and pathophysiology; review current treatment options for HCV infection; recognize investigational agents being studied as part of interferon-free therapy; and summarize clinical trials for the new agents.\",\"The present study was designed to assess the evolution of simeprevir-resistant variants (amino acid substitutions of aa80, aa155, aa156, and aa168 positions in HCV NS3 region) over time in virological non-responders (patients with positive HCV-RNA during and at end of treatment). The study enrolled 136 patients infected with HCV genotype 1b who received 12-week simeprevir-PEG-IFN-ribavirin therapy, and data of 87 patients were available for analysis. Twelve patients (14%) were considered virological non-responders, including 9 (75%) who showed absolute no-response (HCV RNA: \\u22653.0 log IU/ml at 12 weeks after start of therapy). Multivariate analysis of these patients identified lack of response to prior treatment, use of low ribavirin dose, and old age as independent and significant determinants of virological non-response. Using ultra-deep sequencing, de novo variants of D168 were detected in all of 9 absolute non-responders. The majority of these variants emerged within 5 weeks of triple therapy. In comparison, de novo variants of Q80 were detected in only 3 of 9 absolute non-responders and emerged at 6-12 weeks. Variants of Q80 detected at baseline increased during the course of treatment in 5 of 9 absolute non-responders, while no such increase was noted in variants of R155 and/or A156 detected at baseline during the 12-week course. De novo variants of R155 and/or A156 were not detected in this study. The results demonstrated the emergence of simeprevir-resistant variants during the early stage of triple therapy.\",\"IFN-free regimens with direct antiviral agents (DAAs) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) are likely to greatly expand patients' access and response to hepatitis C therapy, while safety and tolerability of treatments seem substantially improved. Sofosbuvir (SOF), a NS5B nucleotide polymerase inhibitor with pan-genotypic activity and a high-barrier to resistance, has been approved by FDA and EMA in an all oral combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C with ribavirin (RBV) alone, or in combination with either pegylated interferon/RBV or other DAAs.\",\"The enteroviruses (EVs) of the Picornaviridae family are the most common viral pathogens known. Most EV infections are mild and self-limiting but manifestations can be severe in children and immunodeficient individuals. Antiviral development is actively pursued to benefit these high-risk patients and, given the alarming problem of antimicrobial drug resistance, antiviral drug resistance is a public-health concern. Picornavirus antivirals can be used off-label or as part of outbreak control measures. They may be used in the final stages of poliovirus eradication and to mitigate EV-A71 outbreaks. We review the potential emergence of drug-resistant strains and their impact on EV transmission and endemic circulation. We include non-picornavirus antivirals that inhibit EV replication, for example, ribavirin, a treatment for infection with HCV, and amantadine, a treatment for influenza A. They may have spurred resistance emergence in HCV or influenza A patients who are unknowingly coinfected with EV. The public-health challenge is always to find a balance between individual benefit and the long-term health of the larger population.\",\"The used first generation protease inhibitors may be hampered by virological failure in partially interferon-sensitive patients.\",\"To assess within the ANRS CO20-CUPIC cohort whether the viral load (VL) at week 2/week 6 for telaprevir/boceprevir-based triple therapy, respectively, was predictive of sustained virological response (SVR) in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and to study the relevance of this measurement to early diagnose drug resistance.\",\"Objective: To evaluate the clinical role of sofosbuvir (Solvadi) in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Data Sources: A MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane search indexed from January 2000 to July 2014 was performed using the search terms GS-7977 and sofosbuvir. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Studies including humans subjects, published in English, and assessing efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir in management of chronic HCV were evaluated. Data Synthesis: Sofosbuvir, a nucleotide analogue NS5B polymerase inhibitor, competes with nucleotides within the hepatocytes resulting in chain termination and inhibition of RNA replication. Trials evaluating the efficacy of sofosbuvir combination therapy have demonstrated significant advantage in sustained virologic response (SVR) over previous therapies. Genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6 patients treated with peginterferon-\\u03b1, ribavirin, and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks achieved SVR rates of 90%. Twelve-week peginterferon-free regimens have resulted in SVR rates of 90% in genotype 2 patients, whereas genotype 3 patients required 24 weeks of therapy to achieve similar results. Favorable SVR rates were also seen in previously difficult-to-treat patient populations including cirrhosis, HIV coinfection, and treatment-experienced. Sofosbuvir appears to be well tolerated and relatively safe, avoiding severe adverse drug reactions, laboratory abnormalities, and resistance issues associated with traditional HCV therapies. The biggest limitation of sofosbuvir is the high cost associated with therapy. Conclusions: Sofosbuvir is a safe and effective treatment option for patients infected with genotypes 1 to 6 HCV including previously difficult-to-treat populations. The shorter duration, oral route, minimal side effects, and decreased resistance potential makes it a welcome addition to the treatment of chronic HCV.\",\"Identifying HCV drug resistance mutations (DRMs) is increasingly important as new direct acting antiviral therapies (DAA) become available. Tagged pooled pyrosequencing (TPP) was originally developed as cost-effective approach for detecting low abundance HIV DRMs. Using 127 HCV-positive samples from a Canadian injection drug user cohort, we demonstrated the suitability and efficiency of TPP for evaluating DRMs in HCV NS5B gene. At a mutation identification threshold of 1%, no nucleoside inhibitor DRMs were detected among these DAA na\\u00efve subjects. Clinical NS5B resistance to non-nucleoside inhibitors and interferon/ribavirin was predicted to be low within this cohort. S282T mutation, the primary mutation selected by sofosbuvir in vitro, was not identified while S282G/C/R variants were detected in 9 subjects. Further characterization on these new S282 variants using in silico molecular modeling implied their potential association with resistance. Combining TPP with in silico analysis detects NS5B polymorphisms that may explain differences in treatment outcomes.\",\"Lethal mutagenesis is a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy that exploits the high mutation rate and low mutational tolerance of many RNA viruses. This approach uses mutagenic drugs to increase viral mutation rates and burden viral populations with mutations that reduce the number of infectious progeny. We investigated the effectiveness of lethal mutagenesis as a strategy against influenza virus using three nucleoside analogs, ribavirin, 5-azacytidine, and 5-fluorouracil. All three drugs were active against a panel of seasonal H3N2 and laboratory-adapted H1N1 strains. We found that each drug increased the frequency of mutations in influenza virus populations and decreased the virus' specific infectivity, indicating a mutagenic mode of action. We were able to drive viral populations to extinction by passaging influenza virus in the presence of each drug, indicating that complete lethal mutagenesis of influenza virus populations can be achieved when a sufficient mutational burden is applied. Population-wide resistance to these mutagenic agents did not arise after serial passage of influenza virus populations in sublethal concentrations of drug. Sequencing of these drug-passaged viral populations revealed genome-wide accumulation of mutations at low frequency. The replicative capacity of drug-passaged populations was reduced at higher multiplicities of infection, suggesting the presence of defective interfering particles and a possible barrier to the evolution of resistance. Together, our data suggest that lethal mutagenesis may be a particularly effective therapeutic approach with a high genetic barrier to resistance for influenza virus.\",\"The identification of mutations in the HVR1 region of hepatitis type C virus (HCV) is time-consuming and expensive, and there is a need for a rapid, inexpensive method of screening for these mutations to predict the ineffectiveness of pegylated interferon alpha combined with ribavirin (PEG-IFN\\u03b1/RBV) therapy. The project was designed to evaluate the usefulness of the high resolution melting (HRM) technique to screen for mutation in the cDNAs encoding the HVR1 and protein kinase R-binding domain (PKR-BD) regions in a group of 36 patients infected with HCV and resistant to 12 months of combined therapy with PEG-IFN\\u03b1/RBV. Viral RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, and the fragments encoding the HVR1 and PKR-BD regions were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified, cloned, sequenced, and the melting profiles and the melting temperature (Tm) were determined by the HRM technique. After the treatment, the melting profiles of HVR1 cDNAs revealed a dominant peak corresponding to the Tm of about 85 \\u00b0C (HCVs85) in almost all patients. One or more minor peaks were also observed, indicating the existence of cDNA(s) of different Tm. The HMR analysis suggested four typical forms of response to treatment. These suppositions were supported by sequencing. The HRM analysis revealed no changes in the melting profiles of PKR-BD cDNAs in the same patient before and after the therapy, suggesting that, within 12 months of treatment, new mutations were not introduced in PKR-BD. These findings were substantiated by sequencing. The HRM technique can be applied for the rapid screening for mutations in the cDNAs encoding the HVR and PKR-BD regions of HCV. We suggest that the detection of HCVs85 peak before the IFN\\u03b1/RBV therapy might predict the ineffectiveness of treatment.\",\"Prior assessment of insulin resistance by HOMA-IR is emerging as an important milestone in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. This cost-effective tool is recommended to individualize treatment duration, or to exclude those with low insulin sensitivity from being treated until ameliorating their state of insulin resistance (IR). The present work aims to elucidate further the effect IR state on early viral kinetic response to Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy and the impact of HCV treatment and viral eradication on insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using the HOMA-IR method. All enrolled patients were treated with a dual therapy (pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin) for 48 weeks and evaluated using qRT-PCR for early virologic response as well as the impact of treatment on insulin sensitivity throughout the early period of therapy. Of a total 392 chronic HCV cases, early virologic response was achieved by 318 (81.1%). IR was detected in 241 (61.5%) chronic HCV patient of which 73.4% responded to treatment. Early virologic response among patients with > 2.18 HOMA-IR value were significantly lower than those with HOMA-IR values \\u22642.18 (P < 0.0001). IR was significantly associated with high baseline BMI. Steatosis and fibrosis correlated with IR but neither independently predicted early virologic response. Pretreatment IR < 2.18, low fasting blood glucose, low and intermediate HCV viral load, normal BMI, and non-smoking were independent factors associated with early virologic response. IR interferes with early virologic response to the antiviral care. Clinical application of pretreatment HOMA-IR assessment could help in predicting early treatment outcome and thus enable treatment regimens to be optimized and individually tailored.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) constitutes a major health concern. Hepatitis C virus eradication by antiviral treatment can markedly reduce the risk of developing cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death. A plethora of new direct antiviral agents have been developed and are being explored in clinical trials. One of the newest members of this family is the NS3/4A protease inhibitor ABT-450. The multi-targeted approach combining ritonavir-enhanced ABT-450 with ombitasvir and dasabuvir has been evaluated for the treatment of CHC Gt1 in treatment-na\\u00efve and treatment-experienced adults. In this article, we sought to discuss the current knowledge on ABT-450-containing regimens, with special emphasis on treatment-experienced CHC Gt1 patients. This new combination was found to be potent, safe and well tolerated. Future Phase III trials with larger sample size in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, non-Gt1, end-stage renal disease and liver transplant recipients are eagerly awaited.\",\"The presence of resistance-associated variants (RAV) may attenuate the efficacy of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) in combination therapy for hepatitis C.

Although major progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying resistance in cancer, there is still more to learn. Our studies provide evidence that Gli1 drives a novel form of drug resistance involving Phase II drug metabolism enzymes, specifically the UGT1A family.\",\"Triple therapy with telaprevir/boceprevir + pegylated-interferon+ribavirin can achieve excellent antiviral efficacy, but it can be burdened with resistance development at failure.\",\"Chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the leading cause of advanced liver disease worldwide. The virus successfully evades host immune detection and for many years has hampered efforts to find a safe, uncomplicated, and reliable oral antiviral therapy. Initially, interferon and ribavirin therapy was the treatment standard of care, but it offered limited performance across the wide spectrum of HCV disease and was fraught with excessive and often limiting side effects. Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a potent first-in-class nucleoside inhibitor that has recently been approved for treatment of HCV. The drug has low toxicity, a high resistance barrier, and minimal drug interactions with other HCV direct-acting antiviral agents such as protease inhibitors or anti-NS5A agents. SOF is safe and can be used across different viral genotypes, disease stages, and special patient groups, such as those coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus. When used in combination with ribavirin or another direct-acting antiviral agent, SOF has revolutionized the HCV treatment spectrum and set the stage for nearly universal HCV antiviral therapy. More so than any other anti-HCV drug developed to date, SOF offers the widest applicability for all infected patients, and new regimens will be tailored to maximize performance.\",\"Hepatitis C disease is a virus mediated infection causing major health problem worldwide. Conversions of immune surveillance play an important role in response to virus clearance. Immune modulating molecules such as HLA-G and IL-10 that convert immune response toward Th2 may play a role to inhibit response from combined therapy with IFN-\\u03b12\\u03b1 and ribavirin. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of HLA-G and IL-10 in responder and non-responder HCV positive patients. In this study, characteristics of the virus and 48 responder and non-responder patients in response to the combined therapy with IFN-\\u03b12\\u03b1 and ribavirin were analyzed. The expression levels of HLA-G and IL-10 were conducted using real-time PCR. Also, soluble HLA-G in both groups of patients and healthy individuals were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. According to the obtained data, HCV 1a was the predominant genotype in responder and non-responder patients. Expression levels of HLA-G and IL-10 in non-responder group was significantly more than responder and control groups (P<0.001). Additionally, expression levels of HLA-G and IL-10 were remarkably higher compared to healthy individuals at the beginning of treatment. Soluble HLA-G in non-responder patients was noticeably increased in comparison to responder patients after treatment (P<0.05). These findings suggest that elevation of HLA-G and IL-10 in HCV infected patients may play an important role in response to combined therapy with IFN-\\u03b12\\u03b1 and ribavirin.\",\"Cancer cells rapidly evolve a multitude of defense mechanisms to evade the effects of the oncologist's drug arsenal. Unfortunately, clinical strategies to overcome these lag far behind. This mismatch likely underlies our inability to implement new durable treatment strategies. Here, a new form of multidrug resistance, inducible drug glucuronidation, is discussed. This form was discovered while developing means to target a specific oncogene, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), with its inhibitor ribavirin. In two clinical studies, ribavirin treatment led to substantial clinical responses, but all responding patients eventually relapsed. In most cases, this was due to the overexpression of the sonic hedgehog transcription factor Gli1, which elevated the UDP glucuronsyltransferase UGT1A enzymes. UGT1As add glucuronic acid to many drugs. Indeed, these cells are resistant to not only ribavirin, but also Ara-C, and likely other drugs. Inhibition of Gli1 reduced UGT1As, eliminated drug glucuronides, and renewed sensitivity to ribavirin and Ara-C. These studies highlight that cancer cells and their resistant counterparts metabolize drugs differently from each other as well as from normal cells. Likely, these inducible modifications go beyond glucuronidation. Understanding the extent of inducible drug modifications and the pathways that drive expression of the corresponding enzymatic machinery will better position us to finally make resistance futile.\",\"Pegylated interferon (IFN) \\u03b1-2a or 2b in combination with ribavirin for children aged 3 years and older is the standard treatment for paediatric chronic hepatitis C. This treatment regimen was developed firstly in adults. In recent years, a number of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) are under development for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. These agents block viral replication inhibiting directly one of the several steps of HCV lifecycle. DAAs are classified into several categories based on their molecular target: HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitors and HCV NS5A inhibitors. Other promising compounds are cyclophilin A inhibitors, mi-RNA122 and IFN-\\u03bb. Several new drugs associations will be developed in the near future starting from the actual standard of care. IFN-based and IFN-free regimens are being studied in adults. In this constantly evolving scenario new drug regimens targeted and suitable for children would be possible in the next future. Especially for children, it is crucial to identify the right combination of drugs with the highest potency, barrier to resistance and the best safety profile.\",\"Both hepatitis C virus (HCV) mono-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected patients are in need of safe, effective, all-oral HCV regimens. In a phase 2 study we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of grazoprevir (MK-5172; HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and two doses of elbasvir (MK-8742; HCV NS5A inhibitor) in patients with HCV mono-infection and HIV/HCV co-infection.\",\"Treatment of hepatitis C is changing dramatically. Various new direct-acting antivirals (DAA) against HCV have recently been approved or will become available during the next months.\",\"In the era of Directly Acting anti HCV Antivirals treatment of hepatitis C is successful in the majority of persons treated. However, treatment of persons with HIV or who inject drugs remains challenging because of special issues: drug-drug interactions with antiretroviral, psychiatric and drug substitution therapies, treatment adherence, impact of treatment on HIV disease course or on risk of bacterial infections. Sofosbuvir induced sustained virologic response in 91% of 23 HIV/HCV coinfected persons treated in combination with ribavirin and pegylated interferon, in 83% of 497 treated in combination with ribavirin and in all 50 patients infected with HCV GT1 treated in combination with ledipasvir and ribavirin. The rates of efficacy in HCV-HIV coinfected were almost the same as those observed in HCV monoinfected suggesting that the efficacy of sofosbuvir is not reduced by HIV coinfection. There are no data on the efficacy of sofosbuvir in injection drugs users. The pangenotypic activity, the high barrier to resistance, the modest potential for drug-drug interactions makes sofosbuvir a reference drug for the treatment of these two special populations.\",\"Sofosbuvir is the first-in-class NS5B nucleotide analogues to be launched for hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment. Its viral potency, pangenotypic activity and high barrier to resistance make it the ideal candidate to become a backbone for several IFN-free regimens. Recent data demonstrated that sofosbuvir either with ribavirin alone or in combination with other direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) as daclatasvir, ledipasvir or simeprevir are able to cure HCV in at least 90% or over of patients. Treatment experienced genotype 3 population may remain the most difficult to treat population, but ongoing DAA combination studies will help to fill this gap. Safety profile of sofosbuvir or combination with other DAAs is good. Resistance to sofosbuvir did not appear as a significant issue. The rationale for using this class of drug and the available clinical data are reviewed.\",\"Although the development of anti-interferon (IFN)-\\u03b1 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is likely to be a common clinical problem for patients with various diseases treated with IFN, anti-IFN-\\u03b1 NAb has been exceptionally considered to have no clinical significance in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C with pegylated IFN-\\u03b1 (Peg-IFN-\\u03b1). However, we recently clarified that the presence of NAb was associated with a non-response to the Peg-IFN plus ribavirin (RBV) therapy. In this study, we used the HCV-replicon system with genotype 1b, and investigated the role of anti-IFN-\\u03b1 NAb in the response to telaprevir (TVR)-containing new antiviral therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Anti-IFN-\\u03b1 NAb-positive sera specifically inhibited the anti-HCV effects of IFN-\\u03b1, without any effect on the activity of IFN-\\u03b2 in vitro. The NAb-positive sera also inhibited the IFN-\\u03b1-dependent induction of interferon-stimulated genes, MxA and OAS-1, in a dose-dependent manner. Although TVR monotherapy decreased the HCV-RNA in vitro, the HCV-RNA was increased again with the development of TVR-resistant mutations. When IFN-\\u03b1 was administrated with TVR, the replication of HCV was continuously suppressed for more than a month. However, in the presence of anti-IFN-\\u03b1 NAb-positive sera, even when IFN-\\u03b1 was combined with TVR, the levels of HCV-RNA exhibited a time-course similar to that with TVR monotherapy, and HCV with TVR-resistant mutations emerged. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the presence of IFN-\\u03b1 NAb decreases the antiviral effects of IFN-\\u03b1 and may be related to the development of TVR-resistant mutated viruses.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection increases the risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the last decade, the current standard HCV treatment, pegylated interferon and ribavirin, have limited efficacy and significant side effects. Novel direct acting antivirals show promise, but escape mutants are expected, along with potential side effects. Pycnogenol\\u00ae, a French maritime pine extract, has been reported to have antioxidant and antiviral effects. Here, we evaluated the effect of Pycnogenol\\u00ae on HCV replication. Wild-type and protease inhibitor (VX-950; telaprevir)-resistant HCV replicon cells were treated with Pycnogenol\\u00ae, Pycnogenol\\u00ae and interferon-alpha, and ribavirin and telaprevir. Pycnogenol\\u00ae effects on replication were also evaluated in HCV-infected chimeric mice. Pycnogenol\\u00ae treatment showed antiviral effects without cytotoxicity at doses up to 50 \\u03bcg/mL. Pycnogenol\\u00ae in combination with interferon-alpha or ribavirin showed synergistic effects. Moreover, Pycnogenol\\u00ae inhibited HCV replication in telaprevir-resistant replicon cells; telaprevir and Pycnogenol\\u00ae acted additively to reduce HCV RNA levels in wild-type HCV replicon cells without significantly increasing cytotoxicity. Pycnogenol\\u00ae antiviral activity was higher than its components procyanidin and taxifolin. Further, treatment of infected chimeric mice with Pycnogenol\\u00ae suppressed HCV replication and showed a synergistic effect with interferon-alpha. In addition, Pycnogenol\\u00ae treatment resulted in dose-dependent reduction of reactive oxygen species in HCV replicon cell lines. Pycnogenol\\u00ae is a natural product that may be used to improve the efficacy of the current standard antiviral agents and even to eliminate resistant HCV mutants.\",\"Simeprevir is an oral hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitor approved for treatment of chronic HCV infection. Baseline NS3 polymorphisms in all patients and emerging mutations in patients who failed to achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) with simeprevir plus peginterferon/ribavirin (PR) in Phase IIb/III studies are described.\",\"It has been suggested that HCV proteins, core, NS3/4A, NS4B, and NS5A, contribute to the resistance of HCV to IFN and ribavirin (RBV) treatments.\",\"The establishment of robust HCV cell culture systems and characterization of the viral life cycle provided the molecular basis for highly innovative, successful years in HCV drug development. With the identification of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), such as NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5A replication complex inhibitors, nucleotide and non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors, as well as host cell targeting agents, novel therapeutic strategies were established and competitively entered clinical testing. The first-in-class NS3/4A protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir, approved in 2011, were recently outpaced by the pan-genotypic nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir that in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, further shortens therapy durations and also offers the first interferon-free HCV treatment option. In the challenging race towards the goal of interferon-free HCV therapies, however, several oral DAA regimens without nucleotide polymerase inhibitors that combine a NS3/4A protease inhibitor, a NS5A inhibitor and/or a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor yielded competitive results. Second generation NS3/4A protease and NS5A inhibitors promise an improved genotypic coverage and a high resistance barrier. Results of novel DAA combination therapies without the backbone of a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor, as well as treatment strategies involving host targeting agents are reviewed herein.\",\"The first standard of care in treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection involving directly acting antivirals was protease inhibitors telaprevir or boceprevir combined with pegylated-interferon and ribavirin (triple therapy). Phase III studies include highly selected patients. Thus, treatment response and development of viral resistance during triple therapy in a routine clinical setting needs to be determined. The aims of this study were to investigate treatment outcome and identify sequence variations after triple therapy in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection in a routine clinical setting.\",\"Hepatitis C currently infects more than 170 million people around the world, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. The current standard of care for HCV infection, including one of the two protease inhibitors, telaprevir or boceprevir, for 12-32 weeks, along with pegylated interferon alfa-2a (PEG-IFN-\\u03b1) and ribavirin for up to 48 weeks, is unsatisfactory in many cases, either because of lack of efficacy or because of treatment-related adverse effects. There is an urgent need of new drugs with improved efficacy as well as a safety profile. Sofosbuvir, a recently approved nucleotide analog, is a highly potent inhibitor of the NS5B polymerase in the Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and has shown high efficacy in combination with several other drugs, with and without PEG-INF, against HCV. It offers many advantages due to its high potency, low side effects, oral administration, and high barrier to resistance. The efficacy and safety were demonstrated in many large and well-designed phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials like NEUTRINO, PROTON, ELECTRON, ATOMIC, COSMOS, FUSION, FISSION, NUCLEAR, POSITRON, and the like. It is generally well-tolerated. Adverse events that occurred include: Headache, insomnia, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, pruritis, upper respiratory tract infections, rash, back pain, grade 1 anemia, and grade 4 lymphopenia; however, the exact safety profile can only be judged when this drug is actually used on a large scale.\",\"Orally administered anti-CD3 antibodies are biologically active in the gut through induction of regulatory T cells, exert an immune-modulatory effect, and alleviate insulin resistance and liver damage in patients with NASH.\",\"Miravirsen is a \\u03b2-D-oxy-locked nucleic acid-modified phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide targeting the liver-specific microRNA-122 (miR-122). Miravirsen demonstrated antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b replicons with a mean 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 0.67 \\u03bcM. No cytotoxicity was observed up to the highest concentration tested (>320 \\u03bcM) in different cell culture models, yielding a therapeutic index of \\u2265 297. Combination studies of miravirsen with interferon \\u03b12b, ribavirin, and nonnucleoside (VX-222) and nucleoside (2'-methylcytidine) inhibitors of NS5B, NS5A (BMS-790052), or NS3 (telaprevir) indicated additive interactions. Miravirsen demonstrated broad antiviral activity when tested against HCV replicons resistant to NS3, NS5A, and NS5B inhibitors with less than 2-fold reductions in susceptibility. In serial passage studies, an A4C nucleotide change was observed in the HCV 5' untranslated region (UTR) from cells passaged in the presence of up to 20 \\u03bcM (40-fold the miravirsen EC50 concentration) at day 72 of passage but not at earlier time points (up to 39 days of passage). Likewise, a C3U nucleotide change was observed in the HCV 5'UTR from subjects with viral rebound after the completion of therapy in a miravirsen phase 2 clinical trial. An HCV variant constructed to contain the A4C change was fully susceptible to miravirsen. A C3U HCV variant demonstrated overall reductions in susceptibility to miravirsen but was fully susceptible to all other anti-HCV agents tested. In summary, miravirsen has demonstrated broad antiviral activity and a relatively high genetic barrier to resistance. The identification of nucleotide changes associated with miravirsen resistance should help further elucidate the biology of miR-122 interactions with HCV. (The clinical trial study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT01200420).\",\"Chronic infection with HCV is a public health problem with approximately 170 million people infected worldwide. Interferon alpha (IFN\\u03b1) sensitivity in liver and IL28B genotype has been identified as important determinants of HCV clearance in the setting of pegylated interferon/ribavirin treatment. Herein, we explored IFN\\u03b1 sensitivity in PBMC from 21 healthy donors and 21 HCV-infected patients treated with pegylated interferon/ribavirin and HCV nonstructural protein-3 inhibitors (i.e. telaprevir/boceprevir). We explored phospho-STAT1 level as read-out for IFN signalling pathway activation in PBMC, T cells and monocytes and correlated results with virological response. We found that PBMC from healthy donors are desensitized to IFN\\u03b1 after priming and challenged with IFN\\u03b1, with a subsequent decrease of phospho-STAT1 and interferon-stimulated genes. Furthermore, we show that CD3+ T cells, but not monocytes, become desensitized after 4 weeks of treatment, with a significant decrease of phospho-STAT1 after ex vivo IFN\\u03b1 stimulation. Finally, we identified baseline phospho-STAT1 level in CD3+ T cells as a potential biomarker of sustained virological response, regardless of the IL28B genotype. In the upcoming costly era of IFN-sparing regimen, baseline IFN\\u03b1 sensitivity could act as biomarker to define cost-effectiveness strategies of treatment by identifying patients who will or will not respond to IFN-based treatments.\",\"The Fat Mass and Obesity-Associated Protein (FTO) gene rs9939609 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance (IR), and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the general population.

Progression of these viral infections to lower respiratory tract may prove fatal, especially in HCT recipients. Increasing evidence on the successful use of ribavirin (alone or in combination with immunomodulators) for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infections in HM patients and HCT recipients is available from retrospective studies; however, prospective clinical trials are necessary to establish its efficacy with confidence. The impact on progression to pneumonitis and/or mortality of treating parainfluenza virus infections with available (ribavirin) or investigational (DAS181) antiviral agents still needs to be determined. Influenza infections have been successfully treated with neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir or zanamivir); however, the efficacy of these agents for influenza pneumonia has not been established, and immunocompromised patients are highly susceptible to emergence of antiviral drug resistance, most probably due to prolonged viral shedding. Infection control measures and an appreciation of the complications following respiratory viral infections in immunocompromised patients remain crucial for reducing transmission. Future studies should focus on strategies to identify patients at high risk for increased morbidity and mortality from these infections and to determine the efficacy of novel or available antiviral drugs.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C infection is a global disease with 160 million people infected worldwide. Until recently, therapy was characterized by long duration, suboptimal success rates and significant adverse drug reactions. The development of direct-acting antivirals initiated a dramatic change in the treatment of hepatitis C.\",\"Ribavirin (RBV) continues to be an important component of interferon-free hepatitis C treatment regimens, as RBV alone does not inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication effectively; the reason for this ineffectiveness has not been established. In this study, we investigated the RBV resistance mechanism using a persistently HCV-infected cell culture system. The antiviral activity of RBV against HCV was progressively impaired in the persistently infected culture, whereas interferon lambda 1 (IFN-\\u03bb1), a type III IFN, showed a strong antiviral response and induced viral clearance. We found that HCV replication in persistently infected cultures induces an autophagy response that impairs RBV uptake by preventing the expression of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1). The Huh-7.5 cell line treated with an autophagy inducer, Torin 1, downregulated membrane expression of ENT1 and terminated RBV uptake. In contrast, the autophagy inhibitors hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), 3-methyladenine (3-MA), and bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) prevented ENT1 degradation and enhanced RBV antiviral activity. The HCV-induced autophagy response, as well as treatment with Torin 1, degrades clathrin heavy chain expression in a hepatoma cell line. Reduced expression of the clathrin heavy chain by HCV prevents ENT1 recycling to the plasma membrane and forces ENT1 to the lysosome for degradation. This study provides a potential mechanism for the impairment of RBV antiviral activity in persistently HCV-infected cell cultures and suggests that inhibition of the HCV-induced autophagy response could be used as a strategy for improving RBV antiviral activity against HCV infection.\",\"Sofosbuvir (SOF) in combination with ribavirin (RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks is the current standard of care for patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 2 and 3, respectively. However, in clinical trials treatment-experienced patients, particularly those with cirrhosis, had suboptimal sustained virological response (SVR) rates. We assessed the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir plus peginterferon and ribavirin (SOF+Peg-IFN+RBV) administered for 12 weeks to treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotypes 2 and 3, with and without cirrhosis. We enrolled 47 patients in this open-label, nonrandomized, uncontrolled phase 2 study. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with SVR at 12 weeks after cessation of study treatment (SVR12). The overall rate of SVR12 was 89% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77-97). Rates of SVR12 were higher in patients with genotype 2 than in those with genotype 3, 96% (95% CI: 78-100) and 83% (95% CI: 62-95), respectively. Rates of SVR12 were similar in patients with and without cirrhosis: for genotype 2, 93% of patients with cirrhosis and 100% of patients without cirrhosis achieved SVR12, and for genotype 3, the SVR12 rate was 83% in patients both with and without cirrhosis. One patient discontinued study treatment because of an adverse event and four patients experienced serious adverse events. The most common adverse events were influenza-like illness, fatigue, anemia, and neutropenia.\",\"The hepatitis C virus remains a global health issue, and the established standard of care has consisted of pegylated interferon alpha in conjunction with ribavirin. However, this regimen is associated with significant side-effects and poor sustained virological responses. The aim of this review is to assess the effects of the direct-acting antivirals upon hepatitis C genotypes 2-6 from publications from the past 18 months.\",\"Interferon alfa-based regimens used to treat recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection after liver transplantation are poorly tolerated, associated with generally modest efficacy, and can interact with immunosuppressive agents. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of an interferon-free regimen of the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir combined with ribavirin for 24 weeks in treating post-transplantation HCV infection.\",\"Advances in understanding the hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle and the urgent need to find complementary direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies has led to substantial advancements in treating chronic hepatitis C. The introduction of telaprevir and boceprevir in 2011 increased the sustained virological response (SVR) rate from approximately 50% to > 70%, but this therapy further restricted patient eligibility and is only approved for treating HCV genotype 1 infection. Interferon has long remained the backbone of HCV therapy and helps prevent viral breakthrough. However, interferon has limited effectiveness and is associated with severe adverse effects and toxicity, especially among cirrhotic patients. Moving to interferon-free therapies should greatly improve SVR rates and offer new treatments for other HCV genotypes and for ineligible patients or patients failing to respond to prior therapies. However, without the relative safety of interferon to suppress viral escape, vigilance will be required to select appropriate therapies and monitor resistance. Several DAAs are currently undergoing clinical trials and will soon undergo the approval process. Goals of future HCV clinical research will be to identify combinations of DAAs with high genetic barriers, investigate optimal treatment doses and durations, and determine the role of ribavirin in DAA therapies.\",\"Virologic failure following treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 with direct-acting antiviral agents is often accompanied by the emergence of resistant variants. MK-5172 is an investigational once-daily protease inhibitor. We analyzed variants in treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients with virologic failure on MK-5172 (100-800 mg/day) plus pegylated interferon alfa/ribavirin (peg-IFN/RBV) during a phase 2 trial.\",\"Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-infected patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) respond poorly to interferon-alpha (IFN-\\u03b1) and ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy, but the reason for this is unclear. We previously reported that HCV-infection induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy response that selectively down regulates the type I IFN-\\u03b1 receptor-1 (IFNAR1) and RBV transporters (CNT1 and ENT1), leading to IFN-\\u03b1/RBV resistance. The goal of this study is to verify whether an increase in ER stress and autophagy response is also associated with the reduced expression of IFNAR1 and RBV transporters in chronic HCV-infected patients.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C treatment for prior non-responders to peginterferon (PegIFN)/ribavirin remains suboptimal. The MATTERHORN study evaluated regimens containing ritonavir-boosted danoprevir (danoprevir/r) in prior PegIFN alfa/ribavirin non-responders.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease, with about 170 million people infected worldwide. The standard regimen for treatment of HCV consists of a combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin. Failure of interferon-\\u03b1 treatment in patients with chronic HCV infection remains a challenging obstacle. Both viral and host environmental factors have been implicated in reducing responsiveness to IFN-\\u03b1 therapy. Host genetic diversity is also believed to contribute to the different clinical outcomes in HCV infection. The objective of the study was to investigate the association of both IL-10 (-819 and -592) and MxA (-88 and -123) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the promoter regions, with response to interferon (IFN) therapy in Egyptian patients infected with HCV genotype 4. Polymorphisms of both genes in 85 HCV patients and 100 controls were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. The frequency of SNP was compared between sustained responders (n = 52) and non-responders (n = 33), as determined by biochemical and virological response to IFN and ribavirin combined therapy. The frequency of the -819T/T and the -592A/A genotypes of IL-10 was significantly higher among responders compared to non-responders (51.92 vs 39.4 %, P = 0.03; 51.92 vs 42.42 %;P = 0.046 respectively). The G/G genotype at position -88 of the MxA gene was significantly lower in responders than in non-responders (25 vs 75.76 %, P = 0.046), whereas heterozygotes (G/T) were more likely responders (65.38 vs 18.18 %, P = 0). The -123C/A genotype was significantly associated with responders (48.08 vs 30.30 %, P = 0.014). Findings suggest that homozygosity for both -819T/T and -592A/A polymorphisms of IL-10 gene and that heterozygosity for both -88G/T and -123C/A polymorphisms of the MxA gene are important host factors that influence the response to IFN therapy in patients with chronic HCV infection.\",\"The combination of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), the current therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, has saved the lives of many HCV-infected patients. Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) target several sites of HCV nonstructural proteins, resulting in the cessation of viral replication. The first NS3/4A protease inhibitors consisted of boceprevir and telaprevir, which have shown superior efficacy against genotype 1 HCV infection when combined with PEG-IFN/RBV compared with the standard therapy in both treatment-naive and -experienced patients. Simeprevir, faldaprevir, and asunaprevir are second-wave, first-generation NS3/4A inhibitors that have already been or will soon be approved. Second-generation protease inhibitors are in clinical trials. Daclatasvir is the first approved DAA belonging to the class of NS5A replication complex inhibitors. The potency of daclatasvir is very high, and this drug is an important and essential component of combination regimens for all genotypes. Sofosbuvir, the first approved NS5B polymerase inhibitor, is characterized by high potency and genetic barriers to resistance. Sofosbuvir combined with RBV achieved an interferon-free regimen in genotype 2 or 3 patients with a reduced treatment duration. It can also be used in combination with PEG-IFN/RBV in genotype 1 patients for 12 weeks. DAAs have provided new hope for curing HCV infections with a short treatment duration and acceptable adverse events.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) modulates intrahepatic cholesterol biosynthetic pathways to promote viral replication. Chronic HCV infection is associated with altered metabolism, including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance (IR), which contributes to disease progression and influences response to therapy. To further understand the impact of HCV infection on host metabolism, we examined changes in serum lipid profiles and intrahepatic expression of lipid-related genes during interferon (IFN)-free treatment of chronic HCV, genotype 1 infection with sofosbuvir and ribavirin (RBV), and explored associations with treatment outcome. Serum lipids (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein [LDL], high-density lipoprotein [HDL], and triglycerides [TGs]) and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) were measured during treatment, while gene expression of lipid-related genes was assessed using paired pre- and end-of-treatment (EOT) liver biopsies from 8 patients (n=7 sustained virologic response [SVR]; n=1 relapse) and unpaired EOT liver biopsies from 25 patients (n=17 SVR; n=8 relapse). Serum LDL concentration and particle size increased early in therapy, whereas TG concentration and very-low-density lipoprotein particle size decreased concomitantly, irrespective of treatment outcome. Whereas LDL increased in patients regardless of treatment outcome, average LDL concentration was lower at baseline and post-treatment in patients who relapsed. Analysis of paired liver biopsies revealed altered expression of genes associated with lipid transport, assembly, and signaling. In unpaired EOT liver biopsies, intrahepatic expression of fatty acid metabolism and lipid transport genes was lower in patients who experienced treatment relapse.\",\"Adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs) possess both a long-term proliferation ability and differentiation capability into enterocytes. As a novel in vitro system for the evaluation of drug absorption, we characterized a human small intestinal epithelial cell (HIEC) monolayer that differentiated from adult ISCs. Continuous proliferation/differentiation from ISCs consistently conferred the capability of maturation of enterocytes to HIECs over 25 passages. The morphologically matured HIEC monolayer consisted of polarized columnar epithelia with dense microvilli, tight junctions, and desmosomes 8 days after seeding onto culture inserts. Transepithelial electrical resistance across the monolayer was 9-fold lower in HIECs (98.9 \\u03a9 \\u00d7 cm(2)) than in Caco-2 cells (900 \\u03a9 \\u00d7 cm(2)), which indicated that the looseness of the tight junctions in the HIEC monolayer was similar to that in the human small intestine (approximately 40 \\u03a9 \\u00d7 cm(2)). No significant differences were observed in the overall gene expression patterns of the major drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters between the HIEC and Caco-2 cell monolayers. Furthermore, the functions of P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein in the HIEC monolayer were confirmed by the vectorial transport of marker substrates and their disappearance in the presence of specific inhibitors. The apparent drug permeability values of paracellularly transported compounds (fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4000, atenolol, and terbutaline) and nucleoside transporter substrates (didanosine, ribavirin, and doxifluridine) in the HIEC monolayer were markedly higher than those of Caco-2 cells, whereas transcellularly transported drugs (pindolol and midazolam) were equally well permeated. In conclusion, the HIEC monolayer can serve as a novel and superior alternative to the conventional Caco-2 cell monolayer for predicting oral absorption in humans.\",\"We analyzed blood samples collected from 15 patients with chronic hepatitis E who were recipients of solid-organ transplants. All patients cleared the hepatitis E virus (HEV) except for 2 (nonresponders); 1 patient died. A G1634R mutation in viral polymerase was detected in the HEV RNA of the nonresponders; this mutation did not provide the virus with resistance to ribavirin in vitro. However, the mutant form of a subgenomic replicon of genotype 3 HEV replicated more efficiently in vitro than HEV without this mutation, and the same was true for infectious virus, including in competition assays. Similar results were obtained for genotype 1 HEV. The G1634R mutation therefore appears to increase the replicative capacity of HEV in the human liver and hence reduce the efficacy of ribavirin.\",\"To provide an overview of a novel anti-hepatitis C agent, sofosbuvir.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been a tremendous health burden worldwide with an annual mortality of 300,000 people due to decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. A combination of interferon (IFN), ribavirin (RBV), and/or direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) can eradicate HCV in a various proportion of infected patients. Unfortunately, IFN-based therapy is associated with significant adverse effects, contraindications, and limited tolerability, leading to lower adherence or even treatment discontinuation. With the rapid evolution of newer DAAs or host-targeting agents, emerging HCV therapy is moving towards an IFN- and RBV-free strategy. To this end, a recently developed NS3 protease inhibitor, asunaprevir (ASV), in combination with other DAAs as IFN/RBV-containing or -free regimen, has shown promising results with fewer adverse effects. In this review, preclinical profiles and clinical proof-of-concept studies of ASV, including viral resistance, host polymorphism, and role of ASV in future HCV therapy are reviewed and discussed.\",\"The launch of first-generation protease inhibitors (PIs) was a major step forward in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment. However, this major advance is, up to now, restricted to genotype-1 (GT-1) patients. However, the ongoing development of new direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) allows new hope for the future. The development of second-wave and second-generation PIs yields higher antiviral potency through plurigenotypic activity, more convenient daily administration, fewer side effects and, for the second-generation PIs, potential activity against resistance-associated variants. NS5B inhibitors (NS5B.I) include nucleoside/nucleotide inhibitors (NIs) and nonnucleotide inhibitors (NNIs). NIs have high efficacy across all genotypes. Sofosbuvir has highly potent antiviral activity across all genotypes in association with pegylated interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (PR), thus allowing shortened treatment duration. NS5A inhibitors (NS5A.I) have highly potent antiviral activity. It has recently been shown for the first time that NS5A.I in combination with PI can cure GT-1b null-responder patients in an IFN-free regimen. In addition, several studies demonstrate that IFN-free regimens with DAA combinations are able to cure a large number of either na\\u00efve or treatment-experienced GT-1 patients. Moreover, a quadruple regimen with PR is able to cure almost all GT-1 null-responders. The development of pan-genotypic DAAs (NIs or NS5A.I) allows new combinations with or without PR that increase the rate of sustained virological response (SVR) for all patients, even for those with cirrhosis and independently of the genotype. Therefore, the near future of HCV treatment looks promising. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the clinical results recently reported for HCV treatment in GT-1 patients.\",\"Treatment with GS-9669, a novel nonnucleoside inhibitor (site II) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural 5B (NS5B) polymerase, resulted in significant antiviral activity in HCV genotype (GT) 1 patients dosed at 50 and 500 mg once daily (QD) and at 50, 100, and 500 mg twice daily (BID) for 3 days. This report characterizes the virologic resistance to GS-9669 in vitro and in GT1 HCV-infected patients from a phase I clinical study. An in vitro resistance selection study with GS-9669 revealed substitutions at several NS5B residues that conferred resistance. The M423 variants were selected at low drug concentrations (5\\u00d7 the 50% effective concentration [EC50]), and the L419, R422, and I482 variants were selected at higher drug concentrations (20\\u00d7 the EC50). During the phase I clinical study, substitutions at NS5B residues 419, 422, and 486 were the predominant changes associated with GS-9669 monotherapy. Substitutions at position 423 were observed only in GT1a patients in the low-dose groups (50 and 100 mg BID). Interestingly, four HCV patients had substitutions at position 423 at baseline. Consistent with the low resistance level at this position, three patients with M423I or M423V at baseline achieved >2-log10 reductions of HCV RNA when treated with 100 mg BID or with 500 mg QD or BID of GS-9669. The fourth patient, who had the M423V substitution at baseline, had a 4.4-log10 reduction of HCV RNA with 500 mg BID of GS-9669. Phenotypic analyses demonstrated that the viral isolates with multiple GS-9669 resistance-associated variants have reduced susceptibility to GS-9669 and lomibuvir (VX-222) but are not cross-resistant to other classes of HCV inhibitors. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT01431898.).\",\"Appropriate antiviral treatment is essential for living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) to be effective for treating hepatitis C. However, it has never been reported that pre-LDLT genetic analyses of both host and virus, with prediction of the outcome of post-LDLT antiviral treatment, indicated LDLT for a borderline case.\",\"Sofosbuvir (Sovaldi, SOF) is a nucleotide analog prodrug that targets the hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) polymerase and inhibits viral replication. High sustained virological response rates are achieved when SOF is used in combination with ribavirin with or without pegylated interferon in subjects with chronic HCV infection. Potential mechanisms of HCV resistance to SOF and other nucleos(t)ide analog NS5B polymerase inhibitors are not well understood. SOF was the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antiviral drug for which genotypic resistance analyses were based almost entirely on next-generation sequencing (NGS), an emerging technology that lacks a standard data analysis pipeline. The FDA Division of Antiviral Products developed an NGS analysis pipeline and performed independent analyses of NGS data from five SOF clinical trials. Additionally, structural bioinformatics approaches were used to characterize potential resistance-associated substitutions. Using protocols we developed, independent analyses of the NGS data reproduced results that were comparable to those reported by Gilead Sciences, Inc. Low-frequency, treatment-emergent substitutions occurring at conserved NS5B amino acid positions in subjects who experienced virological failure were also noted and further evaluated. The NS5B substitutions, L159F (sometimes in combination with L320F or C316N) and V321A, emerged in 2.2%-4.4% of subjects who failed SOF treatment across clinical trials. Moreover, baseline polymorphisms at position 316 were potentially associated with reduced response rates in HCV genotype 1b subjects. Analyses of these variants modeled in NS5B crystal structures indicated that all four substitutions could feasibly affect SOF anti-HCV activity.\",\"Passage of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in human hepatoma cells resulted in populations that displayed partial resistance to alpha interferon (IFN-\\u03b1), telaprevir, daclatasvir, cyclosporine, and ribavirin, despite no prior exposure to these drugs. Mutant spectrum analyses and kinetics of virus production in the absence and presence of drugs indicate that resistance is not due to the presence of drug resistance mutations in the mutant spectrum of the initial or passaged populations but to increased replicative fitness acquired during passage. Fitness increases did not alter host factors that lead to shutoff of general host cell protein synthesis and preferential translation of HCV RNA. The results imply that viral replicative fitness is a mechanism of multidrug resistance in HCV. Importance: Viral drug resistance is usually attributed to the presence of amino acid substitutions in the protein targeted by the drug. In the present study with HCV, we show that high viral replicative fitness can confer a general drug resistance phenotype to the virus. The results exclude the possibility that genomes with drug resistance mutations are responsible for the observed phenotype. The fact that replicative fitness can be a determinant of multidrug resistance may explain why the virus is less sensitive to drug treatments in prolonged chronic HCV infections that favor increases in replicative fitness.\",\"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype-specific impacts on the host metabolic alterations remained inconclusive.\",\"HCV NS3/4A serine protease inhibitors are the first class of direct acting antivirals (DAA) introduced in clinical practice. The first generation agents, selective against HCV genotype 1, are used in association with pegylated interferons and ribavirin allowing increased cure rates at the price of increased toxicity, significant drug interactions and high risk of selecting mutants conferring cross-resistance to the entire class. A large number of second-wave HCV protease inhibitors are currently in clinical development. Advancements include higher potency, activity against a wider number of genotypes, improved tolerability, easier dosing schedules, although their genetic barrier to resistance remains low, especially for subtype 1a, except for the most recent grazoprevir and ACH-2684. The most relevant progress regards the combination with other classes of DAA allowing construction of interferon-free regimens of short duration, good tolerability with exceptionally high cure rates.\",\"Vaniprevir (MK-7009) is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural 3/4a protease inhibitor which significantly increases virologic response rates in HCV genotype (GT) 1-infected patients when added to peginterferon and ribavirin (PR).\",\"Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide, and thus represents a significant public health problem. The type I interferon (IFN), IFN\\u03b1, has been successful in treating HCV-infected patients, but current IFN-based treatment regimens for HCV have suboptimal efficacy, and relatively little is known about why IFN therapy eliminates the virus in some patients but not in others. Therefore, it is critical to understand the basic mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic resistance to IFN action in HCV-infected individuals, and there is an urgent need to identify those patients most likely to respond to IFN therapy for HCV. To characterize the response of HCV-infected patients to treatment with IFN\\u03b1, the expression of an IFN-response gene signature comprised of IFN-stimulated genes and genes that play an important role in the innate immune response was examined in liver biopsies from HCV-infected patients enrolled in a clinical trial. In the present study we found that the expression of a subset of IFN-response genes was dysregulated in liver biopsy samples from nonresponsive hepatitis C patients as compared with virologic responders. Based on these findings, a statistical model was developed to help predict the response of patients to IFN therapy, and compared to results obtained to the IL28 mutation model, which is highly predictive of the response to IFN-based therapy in HCV-infected patients. We found that a model incorporating gene expression data can improve predictions of IFN responsiveness compared to IL28 mutation status alone.\",\"For patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), the combination of the direct-acting antiviral agent telaprevir, pegylated-interferon alfa (Peg-IFN), and ribavirin (RBV) significantly increases the chances of sustained virologic response (SVR) over treatment with Peg-IFN and RBV alone. If patients do not achieve SVR with telaprevir-based treatment, their viral population is often significantly enriched with telaprevir-resistant variants at the end of treatment. We sought to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of these post-treatment resistant variant populations. Previous estimates of these dynamics were limited by analyzing only population sequence data (20% sensitivity, qualitative resistance information) from 388 patients enrolled in Phase 3 clinical studies. Here we add clonal sequence analysis (5% sensitivity, quantitative) for a subset of these patients. We developed a computational model which integrates both the qualitative and quantitative sequence data, and which forms a framework for future analyses of drug resistance. The model was qualified by showing that deep-sequence data (1% sensitivity) from a subset of these patients are consistent with model predictions. When determining the median time for viral populations to revert to 20% resistance in these patients, the model predicts 8.3 (95% CI: 7.6, 8.4) months versus 10.7 (9.9, 12.8) months estimated using solely population sequence data for genotype 1a, and 1.0 (0.0, 1.4) months versus 0.9 (0.0, 2.7) months for genotype 1b. For each individual patient, the time to revert to 20% resistance predicted by the model was typically comparable to or faster than that estimated using solely population sequence data. Furthermore, the model predicts a median of 11.0 and 2.1 months after treatment failure for viral populations to revert to 99% wild-type in patients with HCV genotypes 1a or 1b, respectively. Our modeling approach provides a framework for projecting accurate, quantitative assessment of HCV resistance dynamics from a data set consisting of largely qualitative information.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an RNA virus that chronically infects 2-3% of the world's population. About 25% of these chronic carriers evolve towards liver cirrhosis, a disease that is significantly associated with reduced survival and quality of life. Antiviral therapy can eradicate the infection - a process that is associated with a reduced disease progression rate. Several oral direct agents have been developed and tested for the treatment of HCV infection. This review focuses on the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and resistance of GS-9669, a non-nucleoside inhibitor of viral polymerase, active against HCV genotype 1. In combination with other oral antivirals, GS-9669 results: in very high rates of viral eradication (90-100%) in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, with a good tolerability and safety profile. In conclusion, GS-9669 is a good candidate to be used in interferon-free combinations for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronically infects about 150,000,000 people worldwide and is a relevant cause of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. Antiviral treatment is rapidly moving from interferon (IFN)-based therapy to IFN-free approaches. This review focuses on the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, tolerability, safety and resistance of ombitasvir, which is an inhibitor of the HCV nonstructural protein 5A. The pharmacokinetics of ombitasvir enables its once daily administration. In vivo, in combinations with other oral direct acting antivirals, ombitasvir achieves very high rates of sustained virological response (about 95%) in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection with a good tolerability. Resistance profiling revealed a low barrier to resistance when given as monotherapy. However, coadministration of ombitasvir and other antivirals enhances its barrier to resistance. In conclusion, ombitasvir is a good drug to be used in IFN-free combinations for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.\",\"According to the World Health Organization, approximately 150 million people worldwide are chronic carriers of hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV infection can evolve into cirrhosis of the liver and its complications, which are ultimately responsible for more than 350,000 deaths every year. Antiviral therapy, when successful, is able to decrease the rate of progression and increase survival. Two types of therapies are currently available, ie, interferon-based therapies and interferon-free ones. The latter have several advantages in terms of safety and tolerability, and could be used even in the most advanced stages of the disease. However, their use is restricted to some viral genotypes (genotype 2 and 3) and they are expensive. Several molecules are in an advanced phase of development. This review deals with the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, tolerability, and safety of asunaprevir, an inhibitor of HCV nonstructural 3 protease. Asunaprevir exerts optimal in vitro activity particularly against HCV genotypes 1 and 4, and its pharmacokinetic profile enables twice daily administration. The drawback of asunaprevir, and of all protease inhibitors, is its low barrier to resistance. Consequently, it is used in association with other drugs to prevent resistance. Specifically, when combined with daclatasvir, an NS5A inhibitor, asunaprevir results in a very high rate of viral eradication in both treatment-na\\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients, with a sustained virological response rate of 80%-90%. Tolerability is fair; in fact, asunaprevir is associated with a transient increase in aminotransferase levels, which is mild in most cases. In conclusion, asunaprevir is a good candidate component of interferon-free combinations and may revolutionize the treatment of chronic HCV infection in the near future.\",\"Daclatasvir is a novel NS5A inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Daclatasvir combined with peginterferon \\u03b1-2a and ribavirin in Japanese patients infected with genotype 1b HCV achieved sustained virological response (SVR) in 100% of treatment-na\\u00efve patients, due to high rates of favorable IL28B allele and genotype 1b. SVR 24 was achieved by asunaprevir and daclatasvir in 87.4% of intolerant and 80.5% of nonresponder patients. Baseline NS5A-resistant variants were detected and they failed to achieve SVR. Most patients with genotype 1a experienced virological breakthrough by dual oral treatment, and should be treated QUAD or replaced by all oral regimens that are more potent and have fewer side effects. IFN-free regimens including daclatasvir and asunaprevir for genotype 1 null responders should be tailored to subtype, and preexisting NS5A-resistant variants should be evaluated carefully before choosing the drugs. This regimen alone is unlikely to move forward without additional agents.\",\"Telaprevir and boceprevir, the two first hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitors (PIs), considerably increase rates of sustained virologic response in association with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in chronic HCV genotype 1 infections. The 30 first patients treated by telaprevir or boceprevir including anti-HCV therapies since 2011 in Marseille University hospitals, France, were monitored. HCV loads and plasmatic concentrations of telaprevir and boceprevir were determined on sequential blood samples. HCV NS3 protease gene population sequencing was performed at baseline of treatment and in case of treatment failure. Fifteen patients (including 7 co-infected with HIV) received telaprevir and the other 15 patients (including 4 co-infected with HIV) received boceprevir. At baseline, HCV NS3 protease from six patients harbored amino acid substitutions associated with PI-resistance. Treatment failure occurred at week 12 for 7 patients. Amino acid substitutions associated with PI-resistance were observed in six of these cases. HCV NS3 R155K and T54A/S mutants, all of genotype 1a, were found from four patients. Median (interquartile range) plasma concentrations were 3,092 ng/ml (2,320-3,525) for telaprevir and 486 ng/ml (265-619) for boceprevir. For HIV-HCV co-infected patients, median concentrations were 3,162 ng/ml (2,270-4,232) for telaprevir and 374 ng/ml (229-519) for boceprevir. Plasma drug concentration monitoring revealed undetectable concentrations for two patients at week 4, and probable non-adherence to therapy for another patient. These findings indicate that routine HCV NS3 protease sequencing and plasma PI concentration monitoring might be helpful to characterize cases of therapy failure, at a cost dramatically low compared to that of anti-HCV therapy.\",\"Recently direct-acting antiviral agents, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural 3/4A (NS3/4A) protease inhibitors (PI), have been introduced, and triple therapy regimens that include PI with conventional pegylated interferon \\u03b1 and ribavirin have significantly improved the sustained virological response (SVR) rate, up to 80% for both treatment-na\\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 1. We here report for the first time a case of the successful treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection with a first generation PI drug (telaprevir) based triple therapy after treatment failure with a second generation PI drug (vaniprevir) based triple therapy. A 67-year-old treatment-na\\u00efve Japanese man with HCV genotype 1b infection took part in a phase III clinical trial of vaniprevir-based triple therapy. His serum HCV RNA had become undetectable at week 2 and SVR was highly expected, but HCV RNA reappeared at week 4 after vaniprevir treatment. Polymerase chain reaction direct sequence of the HCV NS3/4A gene at week 8 after vaniprevir treatment showed the emergence of a vaniprevir-resistance mutation (D168V), the probable reason for the treatment failure. Six months later, retreatment with telaprevir-based triple therapy was started. Although the dosages of telaprevir and ribavirin had to be reduced due to severe anemia, the patient achieved an SVR. This case shows the value of repeating PI-based triple therapy with a different drug, a process that would reduce the chance of drug resistant mutation.\",\"Hepatitis C infection represents a major health problem in Egypt; only 20% of patients undergo spontaneous clearance of the virus and around 25% of all patients progress to develop cirrhosis. More than 90% of Egyptian patients have hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype-4. Combined pegylated interferon and oral ribavirin are the current standard therapies for HCV-4. The aim of the work is to evaluate the predictive power of the rs12979860 IL28B SNP and rs12980275 IL28B SNP for treatment response in Egyptian patients infected with HCV genotype 4. One hundred eleven HCV patients receiving combined treatment were studied for rs12979860 and rs12980275 polymorphisms by the restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. The rs12979860 CC and rs12979860 AA genotypes were significantly associated with sustained virological response (p=0.001). Our results suggest that studying IL28B polymorphisms contribute to proper prediction of response to standard therapies in Egyptian patients, optimizing cost effectiveness, and minimizing unneeded adverse effect of therapy.\",\"Antiviral drugs are being used for therapeutic purposes against influenza illness in humans. However, antiviral-resistant variants often nullify the effectiveness of antivirals. Combined medications, as seen in the treatment of cancers and other infectious diseases, have been suggested as an option for the control of antiviral-resistant influenza viruses. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic value of combination therapy against oseltamivir-resistant 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 virus infection in DBA/2 mice. Mice were treated for five days with favipiravir and peramivir starting 4 hours after lethal challenge. Compared with either monotherapy, combination therapy saved more mice from viral lethality and resulted in increased antiviral efficacy in the lungs of infected mice. Furthermore, the synergism between the two antivirals, which was consistent with the survival outcomes of combination therapy, indicated that favipiravir could serve as a critical agent of combination therapy for the control of oseltamivir-resistant strains. Our results provide new insight into the feasibility of favipiravir in combination therapy against oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus infection.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease worldwide. HCV is able to evade host defense mechanisms, including both innate and acquired immune responses, to establish persistent infection, which results in a broad spectrum of pathogenicity, such as lipid and glucose metabolism disorders and hepatocellular carcinoma development. The HCV genome is characterized by a high degree of genetic diversity, which can be associated with viral sensitivity or resistance (reflected by different virological responses) to interferon (IFN)-based therapy. In this regard, it is of importance to note that polymorphisms in certain HCV genomic regions have shown a close correlation with treatment outcome. In particular, among the HCV proteins, the core and nonstructural proteins (NS) 5A have been extensively studied for their correlation with responses to IFN-based treatment. This review aims to cover updated information on the impact of major HCV genetic factors, including HCV genotype, mutations in amino acids 70 and 91 of the core protein and sequence heterogeneity in the IFN sensitivity-determining region and IFN/ribavirin resistance-determining region of NS5A, on virological responses to IFN-based therapy.\",\"Insulin resistance (IR) affects sustained virological response (SVR) to peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin (PR) in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Whether add-on oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) to PR improve SVR remains unclear; therefore, we conducted a prospective, randomized pilot trial on 23 consecutive patients with genotype 1 CHC and IR in Taiwan.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a successful pathogen on the grounds that it exploits its host's metabolism to build up viral particles; moreover it favours its own survival by inducing chronic disease and the development of specific anatomic changes in the infected organ. Steatosis, therefore, is associated with HCV infection by necessity rather than by chance alone. Approximately 6% of HCV patients have steatohepatitis. Interestingly, HCV steatosis occurs in the setting of multiple metabolic abnormalities (hyperuricemia, reversible hypocholesterolemia, insulin resistance, arterial hypertension and expansion of visceral adipose tissue) collectively referred to as \\\"hepatitis C-associated dysmetabolic syndrome\\\" (HCADS). General, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-like, mechanisms of steatogenesis (including increased availability of lipogenic substrates and de novo lipogenesis; decreased oxidation of fatty substrates and export of fatty substrates) are shared by all HCV genotypes. However, genotype 3 seemingly amplifies such steatogenic molecular mechanisms reported to occur in NAFLD via more profound changes in microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha; sterol regulatory element-binding proteins and phosphatase and tensin homologue. HCV steatosis has a remarkable clinical impact in as much as it is an acknowledged risk factor for accelerated fibrogenesis; for impaired treatment response to interferon and ribavirin; and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Recent data, moreover, suggest that HCV-steatosis contributes to premature atherogenesis via both direct and indirect mechanisms. In conclusion, HCV steatosis fulfills all expected requirements necessary to perpetuate the HCV life cycle. A better understanding of the physiology of HCADS will likely result in a more successful handling of disease with improved antiviral success rates.\",\"Sofosbuvir (Sovaldi(\\u00ae)) is a nucleotide hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase inhibitor that has pangenotypic antiviral activity and a high genetic barrier to resistance. This article reviews the clinical efficacy and tolerability of sofosbuvir in patients with chronic hepatitis C and summarizes its pharmacological properties. Interferon-free treatment with sofosbuvir plus ribavirin achieved high sustained virological response (SVR) rates in treatment-na\\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection, and also had efficacy in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection. Sofosbuvir plus ribavirin was also effective in patients co-infected with HCV and HIV, and sofosbuvir plus ribavirin administered prior to liver transplantation prevented recurrent HCV infection in the majority of patients who had HCV RNA levels below the limit of quantification at the time of transplantation. Sofosbuvir plus peginterferon-\\u03b1-2a and ribavirin achieved high SVR rates in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, and also appeared effective in patients with HCV genotype 4, 5 or 6 infection. Oral sofosbuvir was generally well tolerated in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The most commonly reported adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were consistent with those expected with ribavirin and peginterferon-\\u03b1. In conclusion, sofosbuvir represents an important advance in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.\",\"Despite the introduction of protease inhibitors (PI) in the treatment of hepatitis C, the sensitivity of interferon continues to be essential to achieve a sustained virological response (SVR) and to eradicate the viral infection. Currently, pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) are required to avoid selection of PI-resistance mutations. The likelihood of obtaining an SVR with dual therapy in treatment-na\\u00efve patients with genotype 1 infection varies from 40% to 50%. That is, almost half of these patients would not require a PI, thus avoiding their adverse effects and considerably reducing the cost of the treatment. Identifying which patients could potentially respond to dual therapy is one of the main challenges in clinical practice. The genetic variability of the host is one of the main factors affecting the sensitivity of PEG-IFN and therefore in the response to current treatment. Other baseline factors related to the host, the virus and, especially, to intratreatment factors such as rapid virological response (RVR) are strongly associated with the probability of achieving an SVR. The evidence on the decision to prescribe dual or triple therapy according to the factors predictive of response is based on retrospective studies or post-hoc analyses of pivotal studies on PI. Study of the polymorphisms of the IFNL3 gene (IL28B), ITPA, IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), TT/\\u0394G (ss469415590; IFNL4)) and RBV transporters could help in the decision to prescribe dual or triple therapy in treatment na\\u00efve patients.\",\"Resistance to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is driven by the selection of mutations at different positions in the NS3 protease, NS5B polymerase and NS5A proteins. With the exception of NS5B nucleos(t)ide inhibitors, most DAAs possess a low genetic barrier to resistance, with significant cross-resistance between compounds belonging to the same family. However, a specific mutation profile is associated with each agent or drug class and varies depending on the genotype/subtype (e.g., genotype 1b showed higher rates of sustained virological response (SVR) and a higher genetic barrier for resistance than genotype 1a). Moreover, some resistance mutations exist as natural polymorphisms in certain genotypes/subtypes at frequencies that require baseline drug resistance testing before recommending certain antivirals. For example, the polymorphism Q80K is frequently found among genotype 1a (19-48%) and is associated with resistance to simeprevir. Similarly, L31M and Y93H, key resistance mutations to NS5A inhibitors, are frequently found (6-12%) among NS5A genotype 1 sequences. In particular, the presence of these polymorphisms may be of relevance in poorly interferon-responsive patients (i.e., null responders and non-CC IL28B) under DAA-based therapies in combination with pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 plus ribavirin. The relevance of pre-existing resistance mutations for responses to interferon-free DAA therapies is unclear for most regimens and requires further study.\",\"Previous studies have shown that RNA viruses can be attenuated by either increased or decreased viral polymerase replication fidelity. Although foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) high-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) variants with an attenuated phenotype have been isolated using mutagens, no FMDV mutant with a low-fidelity polymerase has been documented to date. Here, we describe the generation of several FMDV RdRp mutants using site-directed mutagenesis via a reverse genetic system. Mutation frequency assays confirmed that five rescued FMDV RdRp mutant populations had lower replication fidelity than the wild-type virus population, which allowed us to assess the effects of the change in replication fidelity on the virus phenotype. These low-fidelity FMDV RdRp mutants showed increased sensitivity to ribavirin or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment without a loss of growth capacity in cell cultures. In addition, decreased fitness and attenuated virulence were observed for the RdRp mutants with lower fidelity. Importantly, based on a quantitative analysis for fidelity and virulence, we concluded that lower replication fidelity is associated with a more attenuated virus phenotype. These results further contribute to our understanding of the replication fidelity of polymerases of RNA viruses and its relationship to virulence attenuation.\",\"Study C210 was a Phase IIa, exploratory trial to assess the activity of telaprevir on hepatitis C virus (HCV) early viral kinetics in treatment-na\\u00efve patients infected with genotype 4 (G4) HCV.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. About 70% of patients exposed to HCV develop a chronic infection, which can lead to scarring of the liver and ultimately to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. For the past decade, the standard therapy for HCV infection has been a combination of interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin. In recent years, direct-acting antiviral agents, boceprevir and telaprevir, have been added to the therapeutic regimen and considerably improve the cure rates for HCV infection. However, the treatment continues to cause substantial side effects and is associated with drug resistance due to frequent mutations in the HCV RNA genome resulting from the low fidelity of its RNA polymerase. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs approximately 22 nucleotides in length. They are derived from cellular or viral transcripts and bind to their target mRNAs in a sequence-specific manner, resulting in either mRNA cleavage or translational repression and subsequent modulation of the expression of the majority of the protein-coding genes. miRNAs have been implicated in regulating multiple aspects of HCV life cycles and certain miRNAs serve as essential mediators for the interferon-based antiviral therapy. Furthermore, recent studies have documented the potential values of miRNAs as novel therapeutic targets against hepatitis C infectivity.\",\"Drug resistance is a major hurdle in oncology. Responses of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients to cytarabine (Ara-C)-based therapies are often short lived with a median overall survival of months. Therapies are under development to improve outcomes and include targeting the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF4E) with its inhibitor ribavirin. In a Phase II clinical trial in poor prognosis AML, ribavirin monotherapy yielded promising responses including remissions; however, all patients relapsed. Here we identify a novel form of drug resistance to ribavirin and Ara-C. We observe that the sonic hedgehog transcription factor glioma-associated protein 1 (GLI1) and the UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A) family of enzymes are elevated in resistant cells. UGT1As add glucuronic acid to many drugs, modifying their activity in diverse tissues. GLI1 alone is sufficient to drive UGT1A-dependent glucuronidation of ribavirin and Ara-C, and thus drug resistance. Resistance is overcome by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of GLI1, revealing a potential strategy to overcome drug resistance in some patients.\",\"New nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) with high genetic barrier to hepatitis B virus (HBV) resistance (such as entecavir, tenofovir) have improved the prognosis of patients with HBV decompensated cirrhosis and have prevented HBV recurrence after liver transplantation (LT). NAs are considered the most proper approach for HBV infection in patients under renal replacement therapy but their doses should be adjusted according to the patient's creatinine clearance. In addition, physicians should be aware of the potential nephrotoxicity. However, patients with chronic hepatitis C and decompensated cirrhosis can receive only one therapeutic option before LT, as well as for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence after LT, which is the combination of subcutaneous Peg-IFN and ribavirin. Generally, therapy for HCV after renal transplantation should be avoided. Although the optimal antiviral therapy for HCV infection has not been established, attention has turned to a new, oral direct acting antiviral treatment which marks a promising strategy in prognosis and in amelioration of these diseases.\",\"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein is a clinically validated target for drugs designed to treat chronic HCV infection. This study evaluated the in vitro activity, selectivity, and resistance profile of a novel anti-HCV compound, samatasvir (IDX719), alone and in combination with other antiviral agents. Samatasvir was effective and selective against infectious HCV and replicons, with 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) falling within a tight range of 2 to 24 pM in genotype 1 through 5 replicons and with a 10-fold EC50 shift in the presence of 40% human serum in the genotype 1b replicon. The EC90/EC50 ratio was low (2.6). A 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of >100 \\u03bcM provided a selectivity index of >5 \\u00d7 10(7). Resistance selection experiments (with genotype 1a replicons) and testing against replicons bearing site-directed mutations (with genotype 1a and 1b replicons) identified NS5A amino acids 28, 30, 31, 32, and 93 as potential resistance loci, suggesting that samatasvir affects NS5A function. Samatasvir demonstrated an overall additive effect when combined with interferon alfa (IFN-\\u03b1), ribavirin, representative HCV protease, and nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitors or the nucleotide prodrug IDX184. Samatasvir retained full activity in the presence of HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) antivirals and was not cross-resistant with HCV protease, nucleotide, and nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitor classes. Thus, samatasvir is a selective low-picomolar inhibitor of HCV replication in vitro and is a promising candidate for future combination therapies with other direct-acting antiviral drugs in HCV-infected patients.\",\"Approximately 30% of HIV-infected patients are co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). After the release of highly active antiretroviral therapy, liver disease has become the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV patients. Prior to 2011, HCV treatment with pegylated-interferon and ribavirin in HCV/HIV co-infected patients only allowed 14-38% of patients with HCV genotype 1 to achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR). Additionally, treatment was commonly discontinued as a result of adverse events. Recently, simeprevir and sofosbuvir have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for HCV mono-infection. Sofosbuvir has been given FDA approval in co-infected patients offering unprecedented SVR rates and the potential for interferon-free therapy. HCV therapies that are in the pipeline offer improved treatment times, safety profiles, and rates of SVR. Despite these improvements, several new issues including adherence, drug-drug interactions with antiretroviral therapies, adverse events, resistance, and patient selection may complicate therapy. This article reviews the current status of direct-acting antivirals (DAA)-containing regimens for HIV/HCV co-infected patients in the USA. New results investigating telaprevir and boceprevir are also discussed as they are relevant for locations where new DAAs are not available. The impact future interferon-free therapies may have on co-infected patients is also discussed.\",\"Ribavirin has proven to be effective against several viruses in the clinical setting and a multitude of viruses in vitro. With up to five different proposed mechanisms of action, recent advances have begun to discern the hierarchy of antiviral effects at play depending on the virus and the host conditions under scrutiny. Studies reveal that for many viruses, antiviral mechanisms may differ depending on cell type in vitro and in vivo. Further analyses are thus required to accurately identify mechanisms to more optimally determine clinical treatments. In recent years, a growing number of ribavirin resistant and sensitive variants have been identified. These variants not only inform on the specific mechanisms by which ribavirin enfeebles the virus, but also can themselves be tools to identify new antiviral compounds.\",\"The phase 3 studies of telaprevir (T) in combination with peginterferon \\u03b1-2a and ribavirin (PR) in treatment-naive genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus-infected patients (ADVANCE/ILLUMINATE) were not designed a priori to assess the effect of race and ethnicity on treatment response. However, these factors are important given the lower sustained virologic response (SVR) rates observed in black and Hispanic/Latino patients treated with PR.\",\"In recent years, clinical research in the field of new treatments for chronic hepatitis C (HCV) has been devoted to developing regimens based on direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), with the goal of increasing treatment efficacy and improving tolerability and safety. This can be achieved by Peginterferon (PegIFN)-free anti-HCV regimens, as PegIFN is responsible for many side effects and limits treatment access due to contraindications in some patient categories. Sofosbuvir (SOF) is the first compound to enter the market with IFN-free combination regimens; it belongs to the nucleotide inhibitors of viral polymerase NS5B and acts as a chain terminator during the HCV replication process, exhibiting pan-genotypic antiviral activity with a high barrier to resistance. Clinical trials in HCV genotype 2/3 patients have demonstrated optimal efficacy in HCV-2, where the combination SOF/ribavirin (Rbv) for 12 weeks resulted in >90% sustained virological response (SVR) rates, while HCV-3 patients with advanced liver fibrosis and previous failure to PegIFN plus Rbv therapy still require individualized and optimized treatment strategies. Historically difficult-to-treat genotypes HCV-1, -4-6 can benefit from reduced duration of PegIFN plus SOF and Rbv, while IFN-free regimens in these patients will be based on SOF in combination with other DAA classes. Due to an optimal tolerability and safety profile with no significant drug-to-drug interactions, SOF is currently undergoing clinical trials in the setting of pre- and post-liver transplantation and HIV-coinfected patients, with the objective to address the until now unmet need for safe and efficient treatment in these populations. This article provides an overview of SOF features and the main clinical trials, discussing key results and potential future developments.\",\"Despite advances in chronic hepatitis C treatment, a proportion of patients respond poorly to treatment. This study aimed to explore hepatic mRNA and microRNA signatures involved in hepatitis C treatment resistance. Global hepatic mRNA and microRNA expression profiles were compared using microarray data between treatment responses. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction validated the gene signatures from 130 patients who were infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1b and treated with pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin combination therapy. The correlation between mRNA and microRNA was evaluated using in silico analysis and in vitro siRNA and microRNA inhibition/overexpression experiments. Multivariate regression analysis identified that the independent variables IL28B SNP rs8099917, hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-17-5p, and MAP3K8 were significantly associated with a poor virologic response. MAP3K8 and miR-17-5p expression were inversely correlated with treatment response. Furthermore, miR-17-5p repressed HCV production by targeting MAP3K8. Collectively, the data suggest that several molecules and the inverse correlation between mRNA and microRNA contributed to a host genetic refractory hepatitis C treatment response.\",\"Safety and tolerability of peginterferon-based hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection therapy remains suboptimal, even when direct-acting antiviral agents are added. This study assessed the efficacy, safety and tolerability of mericitabine combined with ritonavir-boosted danoprevir (danoprevir/r) \\u00b1 ribavirin for up to 24 weeks in treatment-na\\u00efve HCV genotype (G)1 infected patients.\",\"Understanding hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication has been limited by access to serial samples of liver, the primary site of viral replication. Our understanding of how HCV replicates and develops drug-resistant variants in the liver is limited. We studied 15 patients chronically infected with genotype 1 HCV treated with telaprevir (TVR)/pegylated-interferon alpha/ribavirin. Hepatic fine needle aspiration was performed before treatment and at hour 10, days 4 and 15, and week 8 after initiation of antiviral therapy. We measured viral kinetics, resistance patterns, TVR concentrations, and host transcription profiles. All patients completed all protocol-defined procedures that were generally well tolerated. First-phase HCV decline (baseline/treatment day 4) was significantly slower in liver than in plasma (slope plasma: -0.29; liver, -0.009; P < 0.001), whereas second-phase decline (posttreatment days 4-15) did not differ between the two body compartments (-0.11 and -0.15, respectively; P = 0.1). TVR-resistant variants were detected in plasma, but not in liver (where only wild-type virus was detected). Based upon nonstructural protein 3 sequence analysis, no compartmentalization of viral populations was observed between plasma and liver compartments. Gene expression profiling revealed strong tissue-specific expression signatures. Human intrahepatic TVR concentration, measured for the first time, was lower, compared to plasma, on a gram per milliliter basis. We found moderate heterogeneity between HCV RNA levels from different intrahepatic sites, indicating differences in hepatic microenvironments.\",\"HCV infection is a major world health problem, leading to both end-stage liver disease and primary liver cancer. Great efforts have been made in developing new therapies for HCV infection; however, combination therapy with pegylated IFN-\\u03b1 and ribavirin (pegIFN-RBV) remains the first choice of treatment for chronic HCV infection in most countries. The treatment response to pegIFN-RBV remains relatively low. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of persistent HCV infection and pegIFN-RBV resistance will suggest ways of improving the current standard of care and offers new antiviral therapies for both HCV and other viral infections. Recent data suggest that increased expression of hepatic IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) before treatment is associated with treatment nonresponse in patients chronically infected with HCV. Although ISGs are generally antiviral in nature, in the case of HCV, the virus may exploit some of them to its benefit. This is not unique to HCV: Blockade of type I IFN signaling has been shown to control persistent LCMV infection. Thus, in certain viral infections, preactivation or overactivation of type I IFN signaling may contribute to viral persistence. In this review, we briefly summarize the findings from high-throughput gene expression profiling from patients chronically infected with HCV, then focus on a novel ubiquitin-like signaling pathway (ISG15/USP18) and its potential role in HCV persistence. Finally, the role of activation of endogenous type I IFN signaling in persistent HCV infection will be discussed in the context of recent studies indicating that blocking IFN signaling controls persistent LCMV infection.\",\"Using ultra-deep sequencing technology, the present study was designed to investigate the evolution of simeprevir-resistant variants (amino acid substitutions of aa80, aa155, aa156, and aa168 positions in HCV NS3 region) over time. In Toranomon Hospital, 18 Japanese patients infected with HCV genotype 1b, received triple therapy of simeprevir/PEG-IFN/ribavirin (DRAGON or CONCERT study). Sustained virological response rate was 67%, and that was significantly higher in patients with IL28B rs8099917 TT than in those with non-TT. Six patients, who did not achieve sustained virological response, were tested for resistant variants by ultra-deep sequencing, at the baseline, at the time of re-elevation of viral loads, and at 96 weeks after the completion of treatment. Twelve of 18 resistant variants, detected at re-elevation of viral load, were de novo resistant variants. Ten of 12 de novo resistant variants become undetectable over time, and that five of seven resistant variants, detected at baseline, persisted over time. In one patient, variants of Q80R at baseline (0.3%) increased at 96-week after the cessation of treatment (10.2%), and de novo resistant variants of D168E (0.3%) also increased at 96-week after the cessation of treatment (9.7%). In conclusion, the present study indicates that the emergence of simeprevir-resistant variants after the start of treatment could not be predicted at baseline, and the majority of de novo resistant variants become undetectable over time. Further large-scale prospective studies should be performed to investigate the clinical utility in detecting simeprevir-resistant variants.\",\"In clinical trials, treatment with a combination of the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir and the antiviral drug ribavirin was associated with high response rates among patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 infection, with lower response rates among patients with HCV genotype 3 infection.\",\"The interferon-free regimen of ABT-450 with ritonavir (ABT-450/r), ombitasvir, and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin has shown efficacy in inducing a sustained virologic response in a phase 2 study involving patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection. We conducted two phase 3 trials to examine the efficacy and safety of this regimen in previously untreated patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and no cirrhosis.\",\"Treatment of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) is currently undergoing a significant change. Traditional interferon-based therapy has been limited by both efficacy and tolerability, and many direct acting antiviral (DAA) drugs are emerging. Sofosbuvir (GS-7977) is a HCV NS5B nucleotide polymerase inhibitor that has now been evaluated extensively in phase II and III interferon-free clinical trials. The focus of this review is on the clinical potential of sofosbuvir in the treatment of HCV. Sofosbuvir has a pan-genotypic effect on HCV, although viral genotype-specific differences in sustained virological response (SVR) have emerged in phase III clinical trials. Sofosbuvir has been studied both as dual therapy with ribavirin and also as triple therapy with either NS5A inhibitors or a protease inhibitor. High rates of SVR have been reported with these interferon-free combinations, particularly with genotypes 1 and 2, and the safety profile has been very favourable in both cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients, without issues of viral resistance. Interferon-free, once-daily treatment of HCV is now becoming a reality.\",\"Certain host single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect the likelihood of a sustained virological response (SVR) to treatment in subjects infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). SNPs in the promoters of interleukin (IL)-10 (-1082 A/G, rs1800896), myxovirus resistance protein 1 (-123 C/A, rs17000900 and -88 G/T, rs2071430) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) (-308 G/A, rs1800629 and -238 G/A, rs361525) genes and the outcome of PEGylated \\u03b1-interferon plus ribavirin therapy were investigated. This analysis was performed in 114 Brazilian, HCV genotype 1-infected patients who had a SVR and in 85 non-responders and 64 relapsers. A significantly increased risk of having a null virological response was observed in patients carrying at least one A allele at positions -308 [odds ratios (OR) = 2.58, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.44-4.63, p = 0.001] or -238 (OR = 7.33, 95% CI = 3.59-14.93, p < 0.001) in the TNF promoter. The risk of relapsing was also elevated (-308: OR = 2.87, 95% CI = 1.51-5.44, p = 0.001; -238: OR = 4.20, 95% CI = 1.93-9.10, p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression of TNF diplotypes showed that patients with at least two copies of the A allele had an even higher risk of having a null virological response (OR = 16.43, 95% CI = 5.70-47.34, p < 0.001) or relapsing (OR = 6.71, 95% CI = 2.18-20.66, p = 0.001). No statistically significant association was found between the other SNPs under study and anti-HCV therapy response.\",\"A key to effective interferon- (IFN-) free therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) with a high barrier to resistance that can act as the backbone to any regimen. Ideally, this agent should also be active against all HCV genotypes, be well tolerated and have few drug interactions. Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs) that inhibit the function of the HCV RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase fit these requirements and thus hold promise as a cornerstone for new IFN-free regimens. To date, the issue with this class of agents has been toxicity. Numerous NAs in early clinical development have led to significant toxicity leading to their abandonment. However, sofosbuvir, a prodrug of a uridine NA, has moved through development with a clean-safety profile leading to its recent approval. When combined with ribavirin (RBV) alone, sofosbuvir is effective against genotype 2 and even genotype 3 if duration is extended. There are currently limited data with this combination in genotype 1; however, when sofosbuvir is combined with other DAAs of different classes, it is highly effective in almost all patients. To date, sofosbuvir has been studied with protease, NS5A, and nonnucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitors, including as part of a fixed-dose combination single tablet with the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir, with very high rates of SVR with as little as 8 weeks of therapy. Combining two DAAs to sofosbuvir may shorten therapy even further. Because of the poor replicative fitness of the S282T sofosbuvir-resistant variant, resistance to sofosbuvir has not been a significant clinical issue in trials thus far. In addition to sofosbuvir, other NAs are in early-stage development. Provided unanticipated toxicity does not emerge, NAs are likely to play a major role as a backbone for future HCV therapy. The rationale for using this class of agents and the clinical data available to date are reviewed.\",\"The development of new models and tools has led to the discovery and clinical development of a large number of new anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drugs, including direct-acting antivirals and host-targeted agents. Surprisingly, curing HCV infection appears to be easy with these new drugs, provided that a potent drug combination with a high barrier to resistance is used. HCV infection cure rates can be optimized by combining drugs with synergistic antiviral effects, tailoring treatment duration to the patients' needs, and/or using ribavirin. Two HCV drugs have been approved in 2011--telaprevir and boceprevir, both first-wave, first-generation NS3-4A protease inhibitors, two others in 2013/2014--simeprevir, a second-wave, first-generation NS3-4A protease inhibitor, and sofosbuvir, a nucleotide analogue inhibitor of the viral polymerase. Numerous other drugs have reached phase II or III clinical development. From 2015 and onwards, interferon-containing regimens will disappear, replaced by interferon-free regimens yielding infection cure rates over 90%. These therapies will raise new issues, including the need for broad-scale screening and access to care.\",\"Presently, interferon- (IFN-) containing treatment regimens are the standard of care for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Although this therapy eliminates the virus in a substantial proportion of patients, it has numerous side effects and contraindications. Recent approval of telaprevir and boceprevir, targeting the protease residing in nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) of the HCV genome, increased therapy success when given in combination with pegylated IFN and ribavirin, but side effects are more frequent and the management of treatment is complex. This situation will change soon with the introduction of new highly potent direct-acting antivirals. They target, in addition to the NS3 protease, NS5A, which is required for RNA replication and virion assembly and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Moreover, host-cell factors such as cyclophilin A or microRNA-122, essential for HCV replication, have been pursued as therapeutic targets. In this review, the authors briefly summarize the main features of viral and cellular factors involved in HCV replication that are utilized as therapy targets for chronic hepatitis C.\",\"Lipid profile and insulin resistance (IR) are associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and may predict the chronic hepatitis C (CHC) treatment response. The aim of this study was to determine the association between CHC treatment response and lipid profile and IR change during treatment.\",\"The existing standard of care for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection includes the use of pegylated interferon and ribavirin as primary components of treatment, with the addition of a direct-acting antiviral for genotype 1 infection. Sofosbuvir, an oral nucleotide inhibitor of the HCV nonstructural protein 5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme, was recently approved for use in combination with ribavirin and/or pegylated interferon for chronic HCV infection, depending on the genotype. Sofosbuvir is orally administered, and peak plasma concentrations are not affected by food. The drug is renally eliminated and does not require adjustment in mild to moderate renal insufficiency or in any degree of hepatic impairment. Sofosbuvir is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, nor does it induce or inhibit the metabolism of agents that are substrates of these enzymes. Sofosbuvir demonstrates a high barrier to resistance and was well tolerated by patients in clinical trials. Overall efficacy rates vary between 70% and 90%.\",\"BMS-791325 is an allosteric inhibitor that binds to thumb site 1 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. BMS-791325 inhibits recombinant NS5B proteins from HCV genotypes 1, 3, 4, and 5 at 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) below 28 nM. In cell culture, BMS-791325 inhibited replication of HCV subgenomic replicons representing genotypes 1a and 1b at 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) of 3 nM and 6 nM, respectively, with similar (3 to 18 nM) values for genotypes 3a, 4a, and 5a. Potency against genotype 6a showed more variability (9 to 125 nM), and activity was weaker against genotype 2 (EC50, 87 to 925 nM). Specificity was demonstrated by the absence of activity (EC50s of >4 \\u03bcM) against a panel of mammalian viruses, and cytotoxic concentrations (50%) were >3,000-fold above the HCV EC50. Resistance substitutions selected by BMS-791325 in genotype 1 replicons mostly mapped to a single site, NS5B amino acid 495 (P495A/S/L/T). Additive or synergistic activity was observed in combination studies using BMS-791325 with alfa interferon plus ribavirin, inhibitors of NS3 protease or NS5A, and other classes of NS5B inhibitor (palm site 2-binding or nucleoside analogs). Plasma and liver exposures in vivo in several animal species indicated that BMS-791325 has a hepatotropic disposition (liver-to-plasma ratios ranging from 1.6- to 60-fold across species). Twenty-four hours postdose, liver exposures across all species tested were \\u2265 10-fold above the inhibitor EC50s observed with HCV genotype 1 replicons. These findings support the evaluation of BMS-791325 in combination regimens for the treatment of HCV. Phase 3 studies are ongoing.\",\"MK-5172 is an inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 3/4A protease; MK-5172 is taken once daily and has a higher potency and barrier to resistance than licensed protease inhibitors. We investigated the efficacy and tolerability of MK-5172 with peginterferon and ribavirin (PR) in treatment-naive patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection without cirrhosis.\",\"The current treatment of HCV-4 patients is dual therapy with PEG-IFN and ribavirin; however, new drugs against this genotype will be available within few months. Despite the evidenced good virological response in IFN-free regimens, the high cost of these new therapies will require patient selection. In our paper we propose the use of both rs8099917 and rs12979860 IL28-B polymorphisms, in order to identify potentially categories of SVR, null-responder and relapse and consequently to choose the dual therapy or novel approach.\",\"In phase 2 studies, treatment with the all-oral combination of the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir and the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir resulted in high rates of sustained virologic response among previously untreated patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection.\",\"Interferon-containing regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are associated with increased toxic effects in patients who also have cirrhosis. We evaluated the interferon-free combination of the protease inhibitor ABT-450 with ritonavir (ABT-450/r), the NS5A inhibitor ombitasvir (ABT-267), the nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitor dasabuvir (ABT-333), and ribavirin in an open-label phase 3 trial involving previously untreated and previously treated adults with HCV genotype 1 infection and compensated cirrhosis.\",\"Development of antiviral drugs that have broad-spectrum activity against a number of viral infections would be of significant benefit. Due to the evolution of resistance to currently licensed antiviral drugs, development of novel anti-influenza drugs is in progress, including Favipiravir (T-705), which is currently in human clinical trials. T-705 displays broad-spectrum in vitro activity against a number of viruses, including Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV). RVF is an important neglected tropical disease that causes human, agricultural, and economic losses in endemic regions. RVF has the capacity to emerge in new locations and also presents a potential bioterrorism threat. In the current study, the in vivo efficacy of T-705 was evaluated in Wistar-Furth rats infected with the virulent ZH501 strain of RVFV by the aerosol route.\",\"High rates of sustained virologic response were observed among patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who received 12 weeks of treatment with the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir combined with the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir. This study examined 8 weeks of treatment with this regimen.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents a major health issue worldwide due to its burden of chronic liver disease and extrahepatic manifestations including cardiovascular diseases, which are associated with excess mortality. Analysis of published studies supports the view that HCV infection should be considered a risk factor for the development of carotid atherosclerosis, heart failure and stroke. In contrast, findings from studies addressing coronary artery disease and HCV have yielded conflicting results. Therefore, meta-analytic reviews and prospective studies are warranted. The pathogenic mechanisms connecting HCV infection, chronic liver disease, and atherogenesis are not completely understood. However, it has been hypothesized that HCV may promote atherogenesis and its complications through several direct and indirect biological mechanisms involving HCV colonization and replication within arterial walls, liver steatosis and fibrosis, enhanced and imbalanced secretion of inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, endotoxemia, mixed cryoglobulinemia, perturbed cellular and humoral immunity, hyperhomocysteinemia, hypo-adiponectinaemia, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and other components of the metabolic syndrome. Understanding these complex mechanisms is of fundamental importance for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to prevent and to treat vascular complications in patients with chronic HCV infection. Currently, it seems that HCV clearance by interferon and ribavirin treatment significantly reduces non-liver-related mortality; moreover, interferon-based treatment appears to decrease the risk of ischemic stroke.\",\"Approximately 170 million people worldwide are chronic carriers of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Twenty-five percent of them develop liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma during their life. Successful antiviral treatment dramatically reduces the risk of disease progression. HCV infection is treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin; the addition of a protease inhibitor (boceprevir or telaprevir) can also be considered for patients with genotype 1.\",\"Some direct-acting antiviral agents for hepatitis C virus (HCV), such as telaprevir and boceprevir have been available since 2011. It was reported that HCV NS5A is associated with interferon signaling related to HCV replication and hepatocarcinogenesis. HCV NS5A inhibitors efficiently inhibited HCV replication in vitro. Human studies showed that dual, triple and quad regimens with HCV NS5A inhibitors, such as daclatasvir and ledipasvir, in combination with other direct-acting antiviral agents against other regions of HCV with or without peginterferon/ribavirin, could efficiently inhibit HCV replication according to HCV genotypes. These combinations might be a powerful tool for \\\"difficult-to-treat\\\" HCV-infected patients. \\\"First generation\\\" HCV NS5A inhibitors such as daclatasvir, ledipasvir and ABT-267, which are now in phase III clinical trials, could result in resistance mutations. \\\"Second generation\\\" NS5A inhibitors such as GS-5816, ACH-3102, and MK-8742, have displayed improvements in the genetic barrier while maintaining potency. HCV NS5A inhibitors are safe at low concentrations, which make them attractive for use despite low genetic barriers, although, in fact, HCV NS5A inhibitors should be used with HCV NS3/4A inhibitors, HCV NS5B inhibitors or peginterferon plus ribavirin. This review article describes HCV NS5A inhibitor resistance mutations and recommends that HCV NS5A inhibitors be used in combination regimens potent enough to prevent the emergence of resistant variants.\",\"Liver cirrhosis (LC) is a critical stage of chronic liver disease, including that caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV). In the absence of antiviral therapy, 67%-91% of patients with HCV-related LC patients die of liver-related causes, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver failure. Among the therapeutic strategies used to prevent liver-related complications in these patients is standard therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, which induces a sustained virological response (SVR) in 25% of HCV genotype 1-infected patients and in 69% of patients infected with genotypes 2 and 3. SVR in patients with HCV-related LC has been associated with reduced rates of hepatic decompensation, HCC, and mortality. More recently developed direct-acting antiviral agents have shown excellent antiviral efficacy, with preliminary data demonstrating that an interferon-free regimen that includes these direct-acting antiviral agents achieved SVR in more than 50% of patients with HCV genotype 1 LC. Branched-chain amino acid supplementation, improvement of insulin resistance, and the use of \\u03b2-blockers for portal hypertension may also reduce liver-related complications. Here, we review advances in antiviral and adjunctive therapies for improved outcomes in patients with HCV-associated LC.\",\"Genetic factors can play an important role for treatment response and disease progression in chronic viral hepatitis.\",\"Telaprevir, a non-structural (NS)3/4A protease inhibitor, is a direct-acting antiviral drug that inhibits viral replication. Triple therapy with telaprevir, pegylated interferon, and ribavirin is a standard therapeutic regimen for patients with genotype 1b chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and a high viral load. Several factors, including mutations in the NS5A gene, are important predictors of the efficacy of interferon therapy. In this study, we examined the mutational diversity of NS5A and its impact on the efficacy of triple therapy. We enrolled patients with genotype 1b chronic HCV infection and a high viral load (31 males/17 females; mean age, 57.6 years), who were treated with triple therapy. This study was conducted at Kobe University Hospital and at three affiliated hospitals in Hyogo prefecture, Japan, between November 2011 and June 2013. A sustained viral response after 12 weeks (SVR12) was achieved in 37/48 patients (77%). Based on intent-to-treat analysis, SVR12 was significantly greater in patients with the major allele than in those with the minor allele for the IL28B single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; 88 vs. 56%; P<0.05). The prevalence of the V2334I mutation in NS5A was significantly higher in patients who achieved SVR12, while that of G2356E was significantly higher in patients who did not achieve SVR12 (P<0.05). Mutations in the NS3 region that are thought to confer resistance to telaprevir were detected in 3/27 patients who achieved SVR12 (Val36, n=3) and in 5/10 patients who did not achieve SVR12 (Val36, n=4; Thr54, n=1). In conclusion, the IL28B SNP and mutations in the NS5A region were associated with the therapeutic response to triple therapy. Half of the patients who did not achieve SVR12 had mutations conferring resistance to telaprevir. However, pre-existing mutations in NS3 did not affect the efficacy of triple therapy.\",\"Therapy for hepatitis C is undergoing a revolution. Several new drugs against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) have reached the market and many others, including direct-acting antivirals and host-targeted agents, are in phase II or III clinical development. All-oral, interferon-free combinations of drugs are expected to cure more than 90% of infections. A vast amount of data from clinical trials are presented regularly at international conferences or released to the press before peer-review, creating confusion in the viral hepatitis field. The goal of this review is to clarify the current stage of HCV therapy and drug development. This review describes the different classes of drugs and their mechanisms and properties, as well as treatment strategies in development, including those that are interferon-based and interferon-free. HCV treatment options that will be available in 2014-2015 are presented for each genotype. A number of unanswered questions and challenges remain, such as how to treat special populations, the role of ribavirin in interferon-free regimens, the role of HCV resistance in treatment failures, and how to best re-treat patients who failed on treatment. Strategic choices, cost issues, HCV screening, and improving access to care in resource-constrained areas also are discussed.\",\"St John's wort (SJW; Hypericum perforatum) induces CYP3A4 that is involved in the metabolism of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor boceprevir. Reduced boceprevir exposure and efficacy would contribute to therapeutic failure and increase the risk for resistance development. Boceprevir is co-administered with interferon/ribavirin, and depression has been described frequently in patients undergoing HCV treatment. Patients may purchase over-the-counter herbals to manage depression, and knowing the interaction between SJW and boceprevir is desirable.\",\"The treatment for patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 has undergone major changes with the availability of direct-acting antivirals. Triple therapy, containing telaprevir or boceprevir, first-wave NS3 protease inhibitors, in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin, improved rates of sustained virologic response compared with peginterferon and ribavirin alone in patients with HCV genotype 1. However, the development of drug-resistant variants is a concern. In patients treated with telaprevir or boceprevir, different patterns of resistance are observed for the two major HCV genotype 1 subtypes, 1a and 1b. Genotype 1b is associated with a lower rate of resistant variant selection and better response to triple therapy compared with genotype 1a. Similar subtype-specific patterns have been observed for investigational direct-acting antivirals, including second-wave NS3 protease inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors and non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitors. This review explores resistance to approved and investigational direct-acting antivirals for the treatment of HCV, focusing on the differences between genotype 1a and genotype 1b. Finally, given the importance of HCV genotype 1 subtype on resistance and treatment outcomes, clinicians must also be aware of the tests currently available for genotype subtyping and their limitations.\",\"The use of triple-therapy, pegylated-interferon, ribavirin and either of the first generation hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors telaprevir or boceprevir, is the new standard of care for treating genotype 1 chronic HCV. Clinical trials have shown response rates of around 70-80%, but there is limited data from the use of this combination outside this setting. Through an expanded access programme, we treated 59 patients, treatment na\\u00efve and experienced, with triple therapy. Baseline factors predicting treatment response or failure during triple therapy phase were identified in 58 patients. Thirty seven (63.8%) of 58 patients had undetectable HCV RNA 12weeks after the end of treatment. Genotype 1a (p=0.053), null-response to previous treatment (p=0.034), the rate of viral load decline after 12weeks of previous interferon-based treatment (p=0.033) were all associated with triple-therapy failure. The most common cause of on-treatment failure for telaprevir-based regimens was the development of resistance-associated variants (RAVs) at amino acids 36 and/or 155 of HCV protease (p=0.027) whereas in boceprevir-based regimens mutations at amino acid 54 were significant (p=0.015). SVR12 rates approaching 64% were achieved using triple therapy outside the clinical trial setting, in a patient cohort that included cirrhotics.\",\"Epidemiological studies have shown an increased occurrence of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance (IR) and steatosis in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. IR is believed to represent one of the central clinical features of the \\\"metabolic syndrome\\\" and the major pathogenetic factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus. In patients with chronic HCV hepatitis, IR may have several dangerous consequences such as accelerated progression of liver fibrosis, resistance to antiviral therapy and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. According to recent evidence, the global epidemic of metabolic disorders related to incorrect diets will lead physicians to deal with 1.2 billion patients with diabetes in the world in 2025. Given the high prevalence of HCV infection in several countries, metabolic manifestations will contribute to increasing morbidity and mortality in patients with HCV chronic infection in the near future. HCV treatment, shown able to decrease both the occurrence of HCV-related IR and diabetes, may reduce the risk of the associated morbidities.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. HCV establishes a chronic infection in the majority of cases. However, some individuals clear the virus, demonstrating a protective role for the host immune response. Although new all-oral drug combinations may soon replace traditional ribavirin-interferon therapy, the emerging drug cocktails will be expensive and associated with side-effects and resistance, making a global vaccine an urgent priority. T cells are widely accepted to play an essential role in clearing acute HCV infection, whereas the role antibodies play in resolution and disease pathogenesis is less well understood. Recent studies have provided an insight into viral neutralizing determinants and the protective role of antibodies during infection. This review provides a historical perspective of the role neutralizing antibodies play in HCV infection and discusses the therapeutic benefits of antibody-based therapies. This article forms part of a symposium in Antiviral Research on \\\"Hepatitis C: next steps toward global eradication.\\\"\",\"The resistance of Babesia parasites to current anti-babesiosis drugs is an issue of major concern. The inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) of Babesia gibsoni has been identified and characterized as a molecular drug target in our previous studies. In the present study, inhibitory effects of IMPDH inhibitors (mycophenolate mofetil, mizoribine, ribavirin, 7-nitroindole, and mycophenolic acid) were evaluated in vitro or in vivo. In the inhibition assay of recombinant B. gibsoni IMPDH activity, mycophenolate mofetil was the most potent inhibitor (IC(50) = 2.58 \\u00b1 1.32 \\u03bcM) while ribavirin was the least potent. The inhibitory effects of mycophenolate mofetil, mizoribine, ribavirin, and 7-nitroindole on the in vitro growths of B. gibsoni and Babesia bovis were also assessed. The results revealed that mycophenolate mofetil was the most potent inhibitor of the multiplications of both B. gibsoni (IC(50) = 0.13 \\u00b1 0.05 \\u03bcM) and B. bovis (IC(50) = 0.97 \\u00b1 0.49 \\u03bcM). Ribavirin was also the least potent for both B. gibsoni and B. bovis in vitro. Mycophenolic acid, a metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil, caused an inhibition of Babesia microti in mice with noticeable improvement in hematological parameters of the infected mice (ED(50) = 44.15 \\u00b1 12.53 mg/kg). Although the report provides a non-exhaustive view of potential treatment strategy without addressing the potential adverse effect of immune suppression on infections, these results indicated that the IMPDH might be a molecular target of MPA for B. microti . Altogether, we provide a basis for development of antibabesia prodrugs by targeting IMPDH of the parasites in the treatment of babesiosis.\",\"Mutations in NS5B gene of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been reported in patients undergoing antiviral therapy. In the present study, we report emerging clade of HCV-3a in patients administered with IFN plus ribavirin therapy for 24 weeks and having low viral loads (<250 IU/mL). Mutations D/N244E, K304R, N/K307G, Q/T329V, and A338V were found associated with these emerging strains. This distinct HCV could be associated with the increased antiviral drug pressure.\",\": Insulin resistance is associated with nonresponse to hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment. In this multicenter, single-arm pilot study, adult, HIV/HCV genotype 1-coinfected previous nonresponders to peginterferon/ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) with homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance >2.5 were treated with pioglitazone (PIO) for 24 weeks followed by PegIFN/RBV/PIO. Three of 19 subjects (15.8%) achieved undetectable HCV RNA at week 24 of PegIFN/RBV/PIO, which was not significantly different than the historical null rate of 10% (P = 0.29, lower limit of the exact 1-sided 90% confidence interval 5.9%). Over the 24 weeks of PIO monotherapy, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase declined significantly and correlated with improved metabolic parameters.\",\"In patients with chronic HCV infection, an association between IL28B genotype and insulin-resistance (IR), known predictors of sustained virological response (SVR) to pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy, has been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of IR and IL28B genotype in two cohorts of well-characterized HCV patients.\",\"This phase II trial assessed the efficacy and safety of a combination regimen of the nonstructural protein (NS)5A inhibitor ledipasvir (LDV), NS3 protease inhibitor vedroprevir (VDV), non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor tegobuvir (TGV), and ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-na\\u00efve patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 without cirrhosis. Patients were randomized 1:2 to LDV 30 mg once daily (QD; Arm 1; n = 46) or LDV 90 mg QD (Arm 2; n = 94); patients in both arms also received VDV 200 mg QD, TGV 30 mg twice-daily, and RBV 1,000-1,200 mg/day. Patients in Arm 2 with vRVR, defined as HCV RNA below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) from treatment weeks 2 to 10, were randomized 1:1 to stop treatment at 12 weeks or continue for 24 weeks. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12) was higher in patients receiving 90 mg of LDV for 24 weeks (63%), compared with LDV 90 mg for 12 weeks (54%) and LDV 30 mg for 24 weeks (48%). In patients with very rapid virologic response (vRVR) in Arm 2, SVR12 was achieved by 68% and 81% of patients treated for 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. Virologic breakthrough was more common in patients with HCV genotype 1a and was associated with resistance-associated variants for all three direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs); however, in all but 1 patient who relapsed, resistance-associated variants directed against only one or two of the DAAs were detected. The most common adverse events were fatigue, headache, nausea, rash, and diarrhea.\",\"Using hepatitis C virus (HCV) and interferon (IFN) resistance as a proof of concept, we have devised a new method for calculating the effect of a drug on a viral population, as well as the resistance of the population's individual intrahost variants. By means of next-generation sequencing, HCV variants were obtained from sera collected at nine time points from 16 patients during the first 48 h after injection of IFN-\\u03b1. IFN-resistance coefficients were calculated for individual variants using changes in their relative frequencies, and for the entire intrahost viral population using changes in viral titer. Population-wide resistance and presence of IFN-resistant variants were highly associated with pegylated IFN-\\u03b12a/ribavirin treatment outcome at week 12 (P = 3.78 \\u00d7 10(-5) and 0.0114, respectively). This new method allows an accurate measurement of resistance based solely on changes in viral titer or the relative frequency of intrahost viral variants during a short observation time.\",\"The launch of first-generation protease inhibitors (PIs) is a major step forward in HCV treatment. However, the major advance is up to now restricted to genotype 1 (GT-1) patients. The development of second-wave and second-generation PIs yields higher antiviral potency through plurigenotypic activity, more convenient daily administration, fewer side effects and, for the second-generation PIs, potential activity against resistance-associated variants. NS5B inhibitors include nucleoside/nucleotide inhibitors (NIs) and non-nucleotide inhibitors (NNIs). NIs have high efficacy across all genotypes. Sofosbuvir has highly potent antiviral activity across all genotypes in association with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PR), thus allowing shortened treatment duration. NS5A inhibitors (NS5A.I) have highly potent antiviral activity. It has recently been shown for the first time that NS5A.I in combination with protease inhibitors can cure GT-1b null responders in an interferon-free regimen. Besides, several studies demonstrate that interferon (IFN)-free regimens with direct-acting antiviral agent combinations are able to cure a large number of either na\\u00efve or treatment-experienced GT-1 patients. Moreover, quadruple regimen with PR is able to cure almost all GT-1 null responders. The development of pan-genotypic direct-acting antiviral agents (NIs or NS5A.I) allows new combinations with or without PR that increase the rate of sustained virological response for all patients, even for those with cirrhosis and independently of the genotype. Therefore, the near future of HCV treatment looks promising. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the clinical results recently reported for HCV treatment.\",\"Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are either part of the current standard of care or are in advanced clinical development for the treatment of patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1, but concern exists with respect to the patients who fail these regimens with emergent drug-resistant variants. In the present study, ultradeep sequencing was performed to analyze resistance to daclatasvir (DCV), which is a highly selective nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor. Eight patients with HCV genotype 1b, who were either treatment naive or prior nonresponders to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (Rebetol; Schering-Plough) (PEG-IFN/RBV) therapy, were treated with DCV combined with PEG-IFN alpha-2b (Pegintron; Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) and RBV. To identify the cause of viral breakthrough, the preexistence and emergence of DCV-resistant variants at NS5A amino acids were analyzed by ultradeep sequencing. Sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved in 6 of 8 patients (75%), with viral breakthrough occurring in the other 2 patients (25%). DCV-resistant variant Y93H preexisted as a minor population at higher frequencies (0.1% to 0.5%) in patients who achieved SVR. In patients with viral breakthrough, DCV-resistant variant mixtures emerged at NS5A-31 over time that persisted posttreatment with Y93H. Although enrichment of DCV-resistant variants was detected, the preexistence of a minor population of the variant did not appear to be associated with virologic response in patients treated with DCV/PEG-IFN/RBV. Ultradeep sequencing results shed light on the complexity of DCV-resistant quasispecies emerging over time, suggesting that multiple resistance pathways are possible within a patient who does not rapidly respond to a DCV-containing regimen. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT01016912.).\",\"With the introduction of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the field is rapidly evolving towards interferon-free regimens with high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates. The ultimate goal of therapy in chronic HCV infection should include an easily dosed all-oral regimen that is highly effective, inexpensive, pan-genotypic, safe and tolerable, with minimal to no resistance. Various investigational DAA regimens are currently under evaluation with and without ribavirin (Rbv). With the projected arrival of improved therapies over the next 5years, the future role of Rbv comes into question. Despite being plagued by the lack of understanding of its mechanism of action and significant side effects such as anemia, Rbv has been a part of the standard-of-care therapies in chronic HCV infection for more than 10years. As we look towards the future HCV therapy, Rbv may still have utility in the care of patients infected with HCV because of its low cost and potentially added value in combination with other DAAs.

The A(H3N2)v viruses share the A(H1N1)pdm09 M gene containing the marker of M2 blocker resistance, S31N, but do not contain any known molecular markers associated with resistance to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (NAIs). Using a fluorescent NA inhibition (NI) assay, the susceptibilities of recovered A(H3N2)v viruses (n=168) to FDA-approved (oseltamivir and zanamivir) and other (peramivir, laninamivir, and A-315675) NAIs were assessed. All A(H3N2)v viruses tested, with the exception of a single virus strain, A/Ohio/88/2012, isolated from an untreated patient, were susceptible to the NAIs tested. The A/Ohio/88/2012 virus contained two rare substitutions, S245N and S247P, in the NA and demonstrated reduced inhibition by oseltamivir (31-fold) and zanamivir (66-fold) in the NI assay. Using recombinant NA (recNA) proteins, S247P was shown to be responsible for the observed altered NAI susceptibility, in addition to an approximately 60% reduction in NA enzymatic activity. The S247P substitution has not been previously reported as a molecular marker of reduced susceptibility to the NAIs. Using cell culture assays, the investigational antiviral drugs nitazoxanide, favipiravir, and fludase were shown to inhibit the replication of A(H3N2)v viruses, including the virus with the S247P substitution in the NA. This report demonstrates the importance of continuous monitoring of susceptibility of zoonotic influenza viruses to available and investigational antiviral drugs.\",\"Daclatasvir (DCV; BMS-790052) is a picomolar inhibitor of HCV non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) and has demonstrated efficacy in patients chronically infected with HCV.\",\"Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and prior null response (<2 log HCV RNA decline after \\u2a7e 12 weeks of PegIFN/RBV) have limited options.

We evaluated the association between baseline HOMA-IR and pretreatment factors on sustained virologic response (SVR) to telaprevir (TVR) in genotype 1 patients with hepatitis C and prior peginterferon/ribavirin (PR) treatment failure. Patients were randomized to 12 weeks of TVR (750 mg q8h) plus peginterferon (180 \\u03bcg/week) and ribavirin (1,000-1,200 mg/day) (with or without a 4-week lead-in) followed by PR, or PR alone (PR48), for 48 weeks. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses explored the prognostic significance of baseline HOMA-IR alone and adjusted for other pretreatment factors and SVR. The TVR arms were pooled for the purposes of this analysis. In all, 662 patients were randomized; 578 had baseline HOMA-IR and other prognostic data and were included in this analysis. Median baseline HOMA-IR was 2.6 (interquartile range [IQR] 1.7-4.3); 207 (36%), 206 (36%), and 165 (29%) patients had baseline HOMA-IR <2, 2 to <4, and \\u2265 4, respectively. Male gender, higher body mass index, triglycerides, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, maximum alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase, and fibrosis stage were associated with higher baseline HOMA-IR. Baseline HOMA-IR was associated with SVR in univariate analysis, but not after adjustment for other baseline prognostic factors (TVR: OR = 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71,1.29; PR48: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.25,1.43).\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the leading cause of chronic liver-related diseases, including cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, no effective vaccine is available for HCV infection. Polyethylene glycol interferon-\\u03b1 (PegIFN-\\u03b1) in combination with ribavirin (RBV) is the standard of care (SOC) for chronic hepatitis C. However, the efficacy of PegIFN-\\u03b1 and RBV combination therapy is less than 50% for genotype 1 HCV, which is the dominant virus in humans. In addition, IFN and RBV have several severe side effects. Therefore, strategies to improve sustained virological response (SVR) rates have been an important focus for clinical physicians. The serine protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2011. The addition of HCV protease inhibitors to the SOC has significantly improved the efficacy of treatments for HCV infection. Several direct-acting antiviral drugs currently in late-stage clinical trials, both with and without peg-IFN and RBV, have several advantages over the previous SOC, including higher specificity and efficacy, fewer side effects, and the ability to be administered orally, and might be optimal regimens in the future. Factors affecting the efficacy of anti-HCV treatments based on IFN-\\u03b1 include the HCV genotype, baseline viral load, virological response during treatment, host IL28B gene polymorphisms and hepatic steatosis. However, determining the effect of the above factors on DAA therapy is necessary. In this review, we summarize the development of anti-HCV agents and assess the main factors affecting the efficacy of antiviral treatments.\",\"Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are one of the major advances in its medical treatment. The HCV protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir were the first approved DAAs in the United States, Europe, and Japan. When combined with peginterferon plus ribavirin, these agents increase sustained virologic response rates to 70%-80% in treatment-na\\u00efve patients and previous-treatment relapsers with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection. Without peginterferon plus ribavirin, DAA mono-therapies increased DAA-resistance mutations. Several new DAAs for HCV are now in clinical development and are likely to be approved in the near future. However, it has been reported that the use of these drugs also led to the emergence of DAA-resistance mutations in certain cases. Furthermore, these mutations exhibit cross-resistance to multiple drugs. The prevalence of DAA-resistance mutations in HCV-infected patients who were not treated with DAAs is unknown, and it is as yet uncertain whether such variants are sensitive to DAAs. We performed a population sequence analysis to assess the frequency of such variants in the sera of HCV genotype 1-infected patients not treated with HCV protease inhibitors. Here, we reviewed the literature on resistance variants of HCV protease inhibitors in treatment na\\u00efve patients with chronic HCV genotype 1, as well as our experience.\",\"For HCV infection, there have been major advancements during last several years with large numbers of ongoing trials with various direct-acting antivirals (DAA) showing high potency, favourable tolerability profile, higher barrier to resistance, shortened treatment duration, all oral regimen, pan-genotypic, fewer drug interactions and reduced pill burden. By 2014, several DAAs are anticipated to complete successful phase III trials and will be commercially available. Initially, a wave of IFN-based regimen (sofosbuvir, faldaprevir and simeprevir) will be available for treatment of HCV genotype 1. In the near future, combination of antiviral agents with additive potency that lack cross-resistance with good safety profile will likely be the new recommended regimens, making HCV, the first chronic viral infection to be eradicated worldwide with a finite duration of combination DAA therapy without IFN or ribavirin. The aim of this review was to summarize the results obtained from recent DAA combination studies without IFN.\",\"With the approval of second-wave direct-acting antivirals simeprevir, sofosbuvir and faldaprevir in 2014-2015, for genotype 1 hepatitis C, patients and doctors will have more treatment options. During a first period, these treatments will still be used with peginterferon and ribavirin. The second wave of IFN-based triple therapy will have benefits and risk. These treatments have the following advantages: higher efficacy with more patient candidates for a shorten treatment duration (12-24 weeks, instead of 48 weeks). These new treatments appear to have a better safety profile than first generation, with no additional increase in anaemia over peginterferon/ribavirin. Then, these treatments are to take for patients with a decrease in pill burden (these three direct-acting antivirals are given orally one pill a day). Simeprevir and sofosbuvir may be approved in the US and Europe, in 2014, at the time this manuscript will be released. Approval of faldaprevir will follow. These direct-acting antivirals with many others will hopefully be combined in future interferon-free regimens.

The interaction potential of telaprevir has not yet been fully elucidated. The in vitro potency of telaprevir to inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) was assessed and its substrate characteristics for P-gp, BCRP and the multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs, ABCCs) 1-3 were evaluated. The inducing properties of telaprevir on important drug-metabolising enzymes and transporters were also assessed and its ability to activate the pregnane X receptor (PXR) was investigated. Using growth inhibition assays, it was confirmed that telaprevir is a substrate of P-gp and it was demonstrated for the first time that it is not transported by BCRP and MRPs. Telaprevir only moderately inhibited P-gp in the calcein assay and did not inhibit BCRP in the pheophorbide A assay. In LS180 cells, telaprevir strongly induced mRNA expression of ABCG2 (4.3-fold at 30 \\u03bcmol/L) and weakly induced ABCB11, CYP2C19 and UGT1A3. In contrast, telaprevir had no significant influence on mRNA expression of CYP3A4, UGT1A9, ABCB1, ABCC2 and SLCO1B1. In a reporter gene assay, telaprevir did not activate PXR. Thus, it appears unlikely that telaprevir induces CYP3A4 and P-gp in vivo in such a way as to provoke clinically relevant drug interactions. From the numerous perpetrator characteristics, telaprevir's inhibitor properties, especially of CYP3A4 and P-gp, appear to be the most relevant mechanism for drug interactions. The clinical relevance of the strong inducing effects on ABCG2 requires proper assessment.\",\"Type I interferons (IFN-\\u03b1/\\u03b2), with or without ribavirin, have been the only agents that can eradicate the hepatitis C virus (HCV). An IFN-free regimen combining oral direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) will be approved soon for genotype 1 patients. Here, we discuss the role of IFN-\\u03b1/\\u03b2 in the forthcoming \\\"era of DAA\\\" with consideration of limitations and concerns about IFN-free therapies. First, the therapeutic efficacy of first-generation DAA varies among the different subtypes. While the rate of sustained virological response (SVR) is 60-90% among patients with genotype 1b, the rate often falls short of 50% in patients with genotype 1a. IFN and ribavirin can still be indicated for patients with genotype 1a as a platform for combination with DAA. Second, there is concern about the emergence of drug-resistance resulting from inappropriate use of DAA. The clinical significance of pre-existing resistant variants has not been elucidated. Drug resistance may affect the efficacy of next-generation treatments. An IFN and ribavirin backbone in combination with DAA is an effective measure to prevent the emergence of drug resistance and/or to suppress pre-existing resistant viruses. Third, it remains unknown whether the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will be reduced in patients who achieve SVR with IFN-free regimens. In contrast, there are many reports in Japan demonstrating the preventive effects of IFN on the development of HCC. When patients do not achieve SVR with first-generation DAA, low-dose IFN maintenance therapy is a treatment option until the next-generation therapy with pan-genotypic potency and high genetic barrier become available.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces insulin resistance, which improves upon viral clearance. Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor effective against HCV genotype 1. We reported a case, whose history suggests that telaprevir may induce some antidiabetic effect independently of its suppression of HCV. A 56-year-old woman with obesity, type 2 diabetes treated with sitagliptin and metformin, and HCV-related cirrhosis was given triple therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha, ribavirin and telaprevir. After 2 weeks of treatment, HCV RNA was no longer detectable but the patient described a pronounced drop in the capillary glucose levels and episodes of hypoglycaemia that compelled her to stop all antidiabetic treatment. One month after stopping telaprevir, she had to resume her antidiabetic treatment, despite a persisting virological response. Despite reaching a sustained virological response, her diabetes progressed. Although the suppression of HCV replication may have played a role in reducing glucose intolerance, the fact that this patient resumed her prior antidiabetic treatment upon completing the telaprevir treatment, while still aviremic, suggests that telaprevir may have an additional antidiabetic effect. Further evidence about the possible role and mechanisms of telaprevir as antidiabetic agent is warranted.\",\"Evaluation of metabolic factors and elevated \\u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels as independent predictors of treatment failure in a thoroughly documented cohort of HIV-/HCV-coinfected patients (HIV/HCV). Sixty-four HIV/HCV patients treated with pegylated interferon-\\u03b1-2a plus ribavirin (PEGIFN + RBV) at the Medical University of Vienna within a prospective trial were included in this study. In addition, 124 patients with HIV/HCV from the AIFA-HIV and AHIVCOS cohorts were included as a validation cohort. Advanced liver fibrosis, GGT elevation, insulin resistance (IR) and low CD4+ nadir were defined as METAVIR F3/F4, GGT levels >1.5\\u00d7 sex-specific upper limit of normal, homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance >2 and CD4+ nadir <350 cells/\\u03bcL, respectively. HCV-genotype 1/4 (OR26.3; P = 0.006), advanced liver fibrosis (OR20.2; P = 0.009), interleukin 28B rs12979860 non-C/C SNP (OR8.27; P = 0.02) and GGT elevation (OR7.97; P = 0.012) were independent predictors of treatment failure, while both IR (OR3.51; P = 0.106) and low CD4 + nadir (OR2.64; P = 0.263) were not independently associated with treatment failure. A statistically significant correlation between GGT elevation and prior alcohol abuse (r = 0.259; P = 0.039), liver steatosis (r = 0.301; P = 0.034) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (r = -0.256; P = 0.041) was observed. The importance of GGT elevation as an independent predictor of treatment failure was confirmed in a validation cohort (OR2.76; P = 0.026). While GGT elevation emerged as an independent predictor of treatment failure in both the derivation and the validation cohort, no independent associations between metabolic factors and treatment failure were observed. Thus, our findings suggest that GGT elevation is an independent predictor of treatment failure in HIV/HCV that can easily be incorporated into predictive algorithms.\",\"Pretreatment up-regulation of hepatic interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) has a stronger association with the treatment-resistant interleukin (IL)28B minor genotype (MI; TG/GG at rs8099917) than with the treatment-sensitive IL28B major genotype (MA; TT at rs8099917). We compared the expression of ISGs in the liver and blood of 146 patients with chronic hepatitis C who received pegylated IFN and ribavirin combination therapy. Gene expression profiles in the liver and blood of 85 patients were analyzed using an Affymetrix GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). ISG expression was correlated between the liver and blood of the MA patients, whereas no correlation was observed in the MI patients. This loss of correlation was the result of the impaired infiltration of immune cells into the liver lobules of MI patients, as demonstrated by regional gene expression analysis in liver lobules and portal areas using laser capture microdissection and immunohistochemical staining. Despite having lower levels of immune cells, hepatic ISGs were up-regulated in the liver of MI patients and they were found to be regulated by multiple factors, namely, IL28A/B, IFN-\\u03bb4, and wingless-related MMTV integration site 5A (WNT5A). Interestingly, WNT5A induced the expression of ISGs, but also increased hepatitis C virus replication by inducing the expression of the stress granule protein, GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain)-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), in the Huh-7 cell line. In the liver, the expression of WNT5A and its receptor, frizzled family receptor 5, was significantly correlated with G3BP1.\",\"Few anti-influenza drugs are licensed in the United States for the prevention and therapy of influenza A and B virus infections. This shortage, coupled with continuously emerging drug resistance, as detected through a global surveillance network, seriously limits our anti-influenza armamentarium. Combination therapy appears to offer several advantages over traditional monotherapy in not only delaying development of resistance but also potentially enhancing single antiviral activity. In the present study, we evaluated the antiviral drug susceptibilities of fourteen pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus isolates in MDCK cells. In addition, we evaluated favipiravir (T-705), an investigational drug with a broad antiviral spectrum and a unique mode of action, alone and in dual combination with the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) oseltamivir, peramivir, or zanamivir, against oseltamivir-sensitive pandemic influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) and oseltamivir-resistant A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) virus. Mean inhibitory values showed that the tested virus isolates remained sensitive to commonly used antiviral drugs, with the exception of the Hong Kong virus isolate. Drug dose-response curves confirmed complete drug resistance to oseltamivir, partial sensitivity to peramivir, and retained susceptibility to zanamivir and favipiravir against the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 virus. Three-dimensional analysis of drug interactions using the MacSynergy(TM) II program indicated an overall synergistic interaction when favipiravir was combined with the NAIs against the oseltamivir-sensitive influenza virus, and an additive effect against the oseltamivir-resistant virus. Although the clinical relevance of these drug combinations remains to be evaluated, results obtained from this study support the use of combination therapy with favipiravir and NAIs for treatment of human influenza virus infections.\",\"Interferon-based standard of care treatments (SOC) for chronic hepatitis C are unable to provide high cure rates in certain subgroups of the infected population and can cause debilitating side effects. Clinical trials evaluating all-oral, interferon-free treatments have demonstrated high rates of sustained virologic response with no resistance or major adverse events in most populations. As these drug regimens move towards FDA approval, it will be important to assess their cost-effectiveness in addition to their clinical efficacy. A decision-analytic Markov model with a lifetime, societal perspective was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a generalized all-oral drug regimen compared to SOC by modelling the progression of a 50-year-old, HCV-positive cohort through disease natural history and treatment. In base case analysis, all-oral treatment dominated SOC across a range of willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$44,514/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In sensitivity analyses, the model was sensitive to all-oral drug costs as well as rates of SVR and treatment uptake among noncirrhotic subjects, but robust to variations in all other parameters. All-oral treatment was most cost-effective among genotype 1 subjects but remained cost-effective for genotypes 2 and 3 at WTP thresholds \\u2265$80,000/QALY. Quality-adjusted life years gained per dollar spent were maximized in younger treatment cohorts. Using this model, the degree of cost-effectiveness depended on the WTP threshold and the final cost set for approved drug combinations.\",\"Thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C may represent an obstacle for the initiation of antiviral treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate factors predictive of successful pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) \\u03b12b and ribavirin (RBV) treatment for patients with thrombocytopenia with no history of splenectomy or partial splenic embolization. One hundred and fifty-one chronic hepatitis C patients (genotype 1: n = 110, genotype 2: n = 41) with TCP (<100 \\u00d7 10(9) /L) at baseline were enrolled. Pretreatment variables included interleukin 28B (IL28B) genotype (rs8099917) and homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance score (HOMA-IR). The kinetics of haemoglobin and platelets according to the inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) genotype (rs1127354) were investigated. Sustained virological response (SVR) was significantly more frequent in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 (65.9%) than in genotype 1 (34.5%) patients (P < 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis of HCV genotype 1 extracted IL28B TT genotype [odds ratio (OR) 5.97, P = 0.006] and HOMA-IR <2.5 (OR 7.14, P = 0.0016) as significant independent pretreatment predictors of SVR. The analyses of HCV genotype 2 showed that HOMA-IR was significantly related to SVR, but IL28B genotype was not. Patients with ITPA CC genotype showed a significant haemoglobin reduction and lower degree of platelets decrease than those with ITPA CA/AA genotypes. The most common reason for premature discontinuation of treatment was the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 8, 5.3%). In conclusion, HOMA-IR is a useful predictor of SVR for patients with thrombocytopenia infected with HCV genotype 1 or 2 treated with PEG-IFN\\u03b12b and RBV. The inclusion of IL28B, ITPA genotypes and HOMA-IR adds valuable therapeutic information.\",\"Danoprevir (DNV) is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor that achieves high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a-ribavirin in treatment-naive HCV genotype 1 (G1)-infected patients. This study explored the efficacy and safety of ritonavir-boosted DNV (DNVr) plus peginterferon alfa-2a-ribavirin in G1-infected prior peginterferon-ribavirin null responders. Null responders (<2-log10 reduction in HCV RNA level at week 12) were given an open-label combination of 100 mg of ritonavir and 100 mg of DNV (100/100 mg DNVr) every 12 h (q12h) plus peginterferon alfa-2a-ribavirin for 12 weeks. All patients achieving an early virologic response (EVR; \\u22652-log10 decrease in HCV RNA by week 12) continued treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a-ribavirin; those without an EVR discontinued all study drugs. Twenty-four prior null responders were enrolled; 16 patients (67%) were infected with HCV G1b, and 8 (33%) were infected with G1a. Ninety-six percent of patients had an IL28B non-CC genotype. A sustained virologic response at 24 weeks posttreatment (SVR24) was achieved in 67% of patients, with a higher rate in G1b-infected (88%) than G1a-infected (25%) patients. Resistance-related breakthrough occurred in 4/8 G1a and 1/16 G1b patients through the DNV resistance-associated variant (RAV) NS3 R155K. NS3 R155K was also detected in 2/2 G1a patients who relapsed. Treatment was well tolerated. Two patients withdrew prematurely from study medications due to adverse events. Two serious adverse events were reported; both occurred after completion of DNVr therapy and were considered unrelated to treatment. No grade 3 or 4 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations were observed. DNVr plus peginterferon alfa-2a-ribavirin demonstrated high SVR24 rates in HCV G1b-infected prior null responders and was well tolerated. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT01185860.).\",\"The current treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 chronic infection is the addition of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) with a protease inhibitor (telaprevir or boceprevir) to the pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) regimen. In 2014, sofosbuvir, simeprevir and faldaprevir may be available, each in combination with PEG-IFN/RBV triple therapy. All the HCV enzymes are essential for HCV replication, and are potential drug discovery targets. Therefore, DAAs with different viral targets, including NS3 protease inhibitors, nucleoside/nucleotide analogue and nonnucleoside inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and NS5A replication complex inhibitors are under development.\",\"Currently, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is considered a serious health-care problem all over the world. A good number of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) against HCV infection are in clinical progress including NS3-4A protease inhibitors, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, and NS5A inhibitors as well as host targeted inhibitors. Two NS3-4A protease inhibitors (telaprevir and boceprevir) have been recently approved for the treatment of hepatitis C in combination with standard of care (pegylated interferon plus ribavirin). The new therapy has significantly improved sustained virologic response (SVR); however, the adverse effects associated with this therapy are still the main concern. In addition to the emergence of viral resistance, other targets must be continually developed. One such underdeveloped target is the helicase portion of the HCV NS3 protein. This review article summarizes our current understanding of HCV treatment, particularly with those of NS3 inhibitors.\",\"We assessed the outcome of double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) combined with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-1b whose HCV had not disappeared during PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy, or who had relapsed after the end of the therapy. Additionally, we investigated factors predictive of sustained virological response (SVR), including host and viral genetic factors, to DFPP plus IFN/RBV therapy.\",\"We investigated the impact of host genetics represented by the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the IL28B gene and viral genetic variations within the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) [including the interferon (IFN)/ribavirin (RBV) resistance-determining region (IRRDR) and the IFN sensitivity-determining region (ISDR)] on the outcome of pegylated IFN and RBV (PEG-IFN/RBV) treatment.\",\"This study explores viral factors of the interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) resistance-determining region (IRRDR), the IFN sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) and the core protein, and host factor interleukin 28B associated with response to pegylated IFN (PEG-IFN) and RBV combination therapy, and the correlation of viral and host factors with IFN-\\u03bb1.\",\"We assessed drug susceptibilities of 125 avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses isolated from poultry in Vietnam during 2009-2011. Of 25 clade 1.1 viruses, all possessed a marker of resistance to M2 blockers amantadine and rimantadine; 24 were inhibited by neuraminidase inhibitors. One clade 1.1 virus contained the R430W neuraminidase gene and reduced inhibition by oseltamivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir 12-, 73-, and 29-fold, respectively. Three of 30 clade 2.3.4 viruses contained a I223T mutation and showed 7-fold reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. One of 70 clade 2.3.2.1 viruses had the H275Y marker of oseltamivir resistance and exhibited highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir; antiviral agents DAS181 and favipiravir inhibited H275Y mutant virus replication in MDCK-SIAT1 cells. Replicative fitness of the H275Y mutant virus was comparable to that of wildtype virus. These findings highlight the role of drug susceptibility monitoring of H5N1 subtype viruses circulating among birds to inform antiviral stockpiling decisions for pandemic preparedness.\",\"Advances in our understanding of the HCV lifecycle and refinement of in vitro methods to select candidate compounds with anti-HCV activity have led to development of DAA agents and other novel antiviral therapies capable of increasing the curative SVR rates in patients with CHC. The use of the liner protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir, in combination with Peg-IFN-a and ribavirin has become the new SOC for treatment of CHC genotype 1. Rapid development of new protease inhibitors, NI and NNI NS5B polymerase inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors, Peg-IFN-l, cyclophilin inhibitors, caspase inhibitors, and therapeutic vaccines promises to provide even safer and more effective therapy. Combination therapies with 2 or more oral agents may permit elimination of Peg-IFN-a in the near future. Introduction of DAA therapies will confront physicians and patients with regimens of increased complexity, a greater need for compliance, and the necessity of monitoring for virological resistance. Patients with CHC should continue to consider participation in clinical trials of new therapies to accelerate progress.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections remain an increasingly prevalent and emergent health problem worldwide, causing a wide spectrum of liver diseases. Combination therapy with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) of peginterferon alfa-2a and oral ribavirin is currently recognized as the standard treatment of chronic HCV infection. Several complex immunological mechanisms are involved during the course of HCV treatment using interferons. The role of endogenous interferon gamma (IFN\\u03b3) in Egyptian patients infected with chronic HCV and treated with PEG-IFN/ribavirin is uncertain. The goal of this study was to evaluate the association of IFN\\u03b3 and chronic HCV infection among patients treated with combination therapy of PEG-IFN/ribavirin.\",\"The high rate of sustained viral response (SVR) to boceprevir or telaprevir-based triple therapy in hepatitis C (HCV)-related, non-cirrhotic na\\u00efve patients or relapsers to previous antiviral treatment leads clinicians to believe that the impact of metabolic host factors on SVR is minimal when triple therapy is used, unlike what is observed with the peginterferon and ribavirin schedules. This concept is strongly expressed by some opinion leaders on the basis of the data derived from sub-analyses of registrative trials as well as from a post-hoc analysis of the phase II C208 clinical trial. The perception of unrestrainable therapeutic success with the use of newer, more powerful antivirals is now reinforced by the brilliant results obtained with sofosbuvir, an HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor, as well as by the data from the phase II and III studies on the various combinations of second-generation NS3/4A inhibitors and NS5A and/or NS5B inhibitors. However, a great deal of concern has emerged from the real world scenario in which patients are often older and have more comorbidities than patients in the \\\"world of trials\\\". Furthermore, many of them have advanced fibrosis and previous failure with peginterferon and ribavirin treatment. Some data from the recent literature suggest that the host metabolic factors may play a minor but non-negligible role in these difficult-to-treat patients, an issue that will hopefully be investigated in further studies. This editorial aims to provide a detailed analysis of the role that host metabolic factors played in the past and what role they may play in the era of direct antiviral agents.\",\"A stable and persistent Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication cell culture model was developed to examine clearance of viral replication during long-term treatment using interferon-\\u03b1 (IFN-\\u03b1), IFN-\\u03bb, and ribavirin (RBV). Persistently HCV-infected cell culture exhibited an impaired antiviral response to IFN-\\u03b1+RBV combination treatment, whereas IFN-\\u03bb treatment produced a strong and sustained antiviral response that cleared HCV replication. HCV replication in persistently infected cells induced chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and an autophagy response that selectively down-regulated the functional IFN-\\u03b1 receptor-1 chain of type I, but not type II (IFN-\\u03b3) or type III (IFN-\\u03bb) IFN receptors. Down-regulation of IFN-\\u03b1 receptor-1 resulted in defective JAK-STAT signaling, impaired STAT phosphorylation, and impaired nuclear translocation of STAT. Furthermore, HCV replication impaired RBV uptake, because of reduced expression of the nucleoside transporters ENT1 and CNT1. Silencing ER stress and the autophagy response using chemical inhibitors or siRNA additively inhibited HCV replication and induced viral clearance by the IFN-\\u03b1+RBV combination treatment. These results indicate that HCV induces ER stress and that the autophagy response selectively impairs type I (but not type III) IFN signaling, which explains why IFN-\\u03bb (but not IFN-\\u03b1) produced a sustained antiviral response against HCV. The results also indicate that inhibition of ER stress and of the autophagy response overcomes IFN-\\u03b1+RBV resistance mechanisms associated with HCV infection.\",\"Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, myxovirus resistance protein and osteopontin gene polymorphisms may influence the therapeutic response in patients with chronic hepatitis C, and an association with IL28 might increase the power to predict sustained virologic response. Our aims were to evaluate the association between myxovirus resistance protein, osteopontin and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 gene polymorphisms in combination with IL28B and to assess the therapy response in hepatitis C patients treated with pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is responsible for the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It has been a tremendous burden on global health care systems. With the advent of a number of new direct-acting and host-targeting antiviral agents, current interferon-\\u03b1- and ribavirin-based HCV therapy has started to move towards an interferon-sparing or even interferon-free strategy. In this regard, a recently identified NS5A inhibitor, daclatasvir, showed a great promise in clinical trials as another new class of direct-acting anti-HCV therapeutics, with a distinct mechanism of action. In this review, a variety of preclinical as well as clinical proof-of-concept studies of daclatasvir, including the studies of its discovery, mechanism of action, viral resistance, and host polymorphism profiles are reviewed. In addition, a role of daclatasvir in the future therapy for HCV patients is discussed briefly.\",\"Until very recently, treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been based on the combination of two non-viral specific drugs: pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin, which is effective in, overall, about 40%-50% of cases. To improve the response to treatment, novel drugs have been designed to specifically block viral proteins. Multiple compounds are under development, and the approval for clinical use of the first of such direct-acting antivirals in 2011 (Telaprevir and Boceprevir), represents a milestone in HCV treatment. HCV therapeutics is entering a new expanding era, and a highly-effective cure is envisioned for the first time since the discovery of the virus in 1989. However, any antiviral treatment may be limited by the capacity of the virus to overcome the selective pressure of new drugs, generating antiviral resistance. Here, we try to provide a basic overview of new treatments, HCV resistance to new antivirals and some considerations derived from a Public Health perspective, using HCV resistance to protease and polymerase inhibitors as examples.\",\"Antiviral treatment is the only option to prevent or defer the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). The approved medication for the treatment of chronic HBV infection is interferon-\\u03b1 (IFN\\u03b1) and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs), including lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, telbivudine, entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. IFN\\u03b1 is the most suitable for young patients with less advanced liver diseases and those infected with HBV genotype A. IFN\\u03b1 treatment significantly decreases the overall incidence of HBV-related HCC in sustained responders. However, side effects may limit its long-term clinical application. Orally administered NAs are typically implemented for patients with more advanced liver diseases. NA treatment significantly reduces disease progression of cirrhosis and therefore HCC incidence, especially in HBV e antigen-positive patients. NA-resistance due to the mutations in HBV polymerase is a major limiting factor. Of the NA resistance-associated mutants, A181T mutant significantly increases the risk of HCC development during the subsequent course of NA therapy. It is important to initiate treatment with NAs that have a high genetic barrier to resistance, to counsel patients on medication adherence and to monitor virological breakthroughs. The recommended treatment for patients with chronic HCV infection is peg-IFN plus ribavirin that can decrease the occurrence of HCC in those who achieve a sustained virological response and have not yet progressed to cirrhosis. IFN-based treatment is reserved for patients with decompensated cirrhosis who are under evaluation of liver transplantation to reduce post-transplant recurrence of HCV. More effective therapeutic options such as direct acting antiviral agents will hopefully increase the response rate in difficult-to-treat patients with HCV genotype 1. However, the risk of HCC remains in cirrhotic patients (both chronic HBV and HCV infection) if treatment is initiated after cirrhosis is established. Future research should focus on investigating new agents, especially for those patients with hepatic decompensation or post-transplantation.\",\"Enhanced endogenous interferon (IFN) stimulated gene (ISG) signature has been associated with nonresponsiveness to hepatitis C treatment using pegylated-IFN\\u03b1 (pegIFN\\u03b1) and ribavirin (RBV) in human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus (HIV/HCV) coinfected patients. Using a proteomic approach, we identified high levels of IFN\\u03b1 receptor 2a (IFN\\u03b1R2a) in the serum of null responders to pegIFN\\u03b1/RBV. IFN\\u03b1R2a inhibited antiviral activity of all formulations of IFN\\u03b1 in JFH/Huh7.5 cells. Furthermore, serum from null responders, but not from those who achieved sustained virologic response, suppressed IFN-signaling and ISG expression in IFN\\u03b1-stimulated PBMCs of healthy donors in an IFN\\u03b1R2a specific fashion. An IFN\\u03b1R2a transgenic mice model (C57BL/6) was generated that had significantly higher levels of IFN\\u03b1R2a in the serum than the controls (P=0.001). Total ISG expression in the lymph nodes was significantly higher compared to wild-type mice (P value=0.0016). In addition, IFITM1 and SP110 had significantly increased expression in the liver, IFITM1 and ISG15 in the lymph node, and ISG15 and PLSCR1 in the spleen (P value<0.05). The underlying mechanism of resistance to hepatitis C treatment may involve transsignaling of the JAK/STAT pathway by the sIFN\\u03b1R2a-IFN\\u03b1/\\u03b2 complex and result in the enhanced ISG signature observed in null responders. In this regard, the transgenic mice model simulated nonresponders to IFN\\u03b1 therapy and provides valuable insights into the role of sIFN\\u03b1R2a-IFN\\u03b1 interactions in vivo.\",\"Narlaprevir, a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A serine protease inhibitor, has demonstrated robust antiviral activity in a placebo-controlled phase 1 study. To study evolutionary dynamics of resistant variants, the NS3 protease sequence was clonally analysed in thirty-two HCV genotype 1-infected patients following treatment with narlaprevir. Narlaprevir monotherapy was administered for one week (period 1) followed by narlaprevir/pegylated interferon-alpha-2b combination therapy with or without ritonavir (period 2) during two weeks, interrupted by a washout period of one month. Thereafter, all patients initiated pegylated interferon-alpha-2b/ribavirin combination therapy. Longitudinal clonal analysis was performed in those patients with NS3 mutations. After narlaprevir re-exposure, resistance-associated mutations at position V36, T54, R155 and A156 were detected in five patients in >95% of the clones. Narlaprevir retreatment resulted in a 2.58 and 5.06 log10 IU/mL viral load decline in patients with and without mutations, respectively (P=<0.01). After treatment, resistant variants were replaced with wild-type virus within 2-24 weeks in three patients. However, the R155K mutation was still observed 3.1 years after narlaprevir dosing in two patients in 5% and 45% of the viral population. Resistant variants could be detected early during treatment with narlaprevir. A slower viral load decline was observed in those patients with resistance-associated mutations detectable by direct population sequencing. These mutations disappeared within six months following treatment with the exception of R155K mutation, which persisted in two patients.\",\"Resistance to mericitabine (prodrug of HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor PSI-6130) is rare and conferred by the NS5B S282T mutation.\",\"Specific human polymorphisms, most commonly found in Central Africa, can predict the success of drug treatment against the hepatitis C virus (HCV), a significant and globally-distributed human pathogen. However, this association is only found for a subset of HCV genotypes. Despite receiving considerable attention in the medical and virological literature, no evolutionary explanation for this curious pattern has been put forward. Here we suggest that the 'drug treatment resistance' phenotype exhibited today by some HCV genotypes evolved hundreds to thousands of years ago in response to human genetic variation local to Central Africa: an adaptation that has since accrued a new function in the era of anti-viral drug treatment. This could represent one of the oldest known examples of viral exaptation at the population level.\",\"In HCV genotype 1-infected patients with HIV co-infection, tritherapy [HCV protease inhibitors (PIs) plus peg-interferon and ribavirin] has been shown to have an increased rate of sustained virological response.

This population-based cohort study aimed to investigate whether antiviral therapy for HCV infection was associated with improved clinical outcomes related to diabetes. From the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 2,267,270 Taiwanese residents diagnosed with diabetes mellitus were screened for eligibility. HCV infection was defined by a specific diagnosis code and measurement of serum antibody. After excluding patients with serious comorbidity, we enrolled a total of 1,411 eligible patients who received pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (treated cohort), and matched them 1:1 with 1,411 untreated controls by propensity scores (untreated cohort). We also matched the treated cohort 1:4 with 5,644 diabetic patients without HCV infection (uninfected cohort). Participants were followed up for the occurrence of endstage renal disease (ESRD), ischemic stroke, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) after receiving antiviral treatment or the corresponding calendar date. From 2003 to 2011, the 8-year cumulative incidences of ESRD in the treated, untreated, and uninfected cohorts were 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-2.0%), 9.3% (95% CI, 5.9-12.7%), and 3.3% (95% CI, 2.3-4.3%), respectively (P < 0.001); those of stroke were 3.1% (95% CI, 1.1-5.0%), 5.3% (95% CI, 3.0-7.5%), and 6.1% (95% CI, 4.8-7.4%), respectively (P = 0.01); and those for ACS were 4.1% (95% CI, 2.1-6.1%), 6.6% (95% CI, 3.7-9.5%), and 7.4% (95% CI, 5.9-9.0%), respectively (P = 0.05). As compared with the untreated cohort, antiviral treatment was associated with multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios of 0.16 (95% CI, 0.07-0.33%) for ESRD, 0.53 (95% CI, 0.30-0.93) for ischemic stroke, and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.39-1.06) for ACS.\",\"The combination of vaniprevir (a NS3/4A protease inhibitor) with peginterferon and ribavirin was shown to increase rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) significantly, compared with peginterferon and ribavirin alone, in treatment-experienced patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection without cirrhosis.

Currently available interferon-based medication is successful in up to 75% of the patients infected with HCV genotypes 1, 2 or 3 and lower efficacy in other genotypes. Unfortunately sustained virologic response (SVR) rate in genotype 1 infected non-responders to previous therapy with advanced hepatic fibrosis even after retreatment with the first generation direct acting antivirals (DAA) is about 40% only.\",\"Telaprevir is a linear, peptidomimetic small molecule that inhibits hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication by specifically inhibiting the NS3\\u00b74A protease. In phase 3 clinical studies, telaprevir in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin (PR) significantly improved sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in genotype 1 chronic HCV-infected patients compared with PR alone. In patients who do not achieve SVR after treatment with telaprevir-based regimens, variants with mutations in the NS3\\u00b74A protease region have been observed. Such variants can contribute to drug resistance and limit the efficacy of treatment. To gain a better understanding of the viral resistance profile, we conducted phenotypic characterization of the variants using HCV replicons carrying site-directed mutations. The most frequently observed (significantly enriched) telaprevir-resistant variants, V36A/M, T54A/S, R155K/T, and A156S, conferred lower-level resistance (3- to 25-fold), whereas A156T and V36M+R155K conferred higher-level resistance (>25-fold) to telaprevir. Rarely observed (not significantly enriched) variants included V36I/L and I132V, which did not confer resistance to telaprevir; V36C/G, R155G/I/M/S, V36A+T54A, V36L+R155K, T54S+R155K, and R155T+D168N, which conferred lower-level resistance to telaprevir; and A156F/N/V, V36A+R155K/T, V36M+R155T, V36A/M+A156T, T54A+A156S, T54S+A156S/T, and V36M+T54S+R155K, which conferred higher-level resistance to telaprevir. All telaprevir-resistant variants remained fully sensitive to alpha interferon, ribavirin, and HCV NS5B nucleoside and nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitors. In general, the replication capacity of telaprevir-resistant variants was lower than that of the wild-type replicon.\",\"Despite the incontestable benefits of telaprevir and boceprevir-based triple therapy in patients infected with genotype 1, the practitioner faces a number of new challenges. In daily clinical practice, a checklist approach may facilitate the management of triple therapy. Before initiation, several specific issues should be reviewed with the patient in order to optimize adherence and treatment outcome: potential drug to drug interaction, treatment duration and stopping rules, possible treatment outcomes, side effects, dose and administration with food advice, management of side effects. Because treatment failure is associated with the emergence of resistance-associated variants with reduced sensitivity to protease inhibitors, adherence is of major importance. In this setting, the role of educational nurse should be emphasized for the management of triple therapy in daily clinical practice.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease and a potential cause of substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. The overall prevalence of HCV infection is 2%, representing 120 million people worldwide. Current standard treatment using pegylated interferon and ribavirin is effective in only 50% of the patients infected with HCV genotype 1, and is associated with significant side effects. Therefore, it is still of importance to develop new drugs for treatment of HCV. Antiviral substances obtained from natural products, including medicinal plants, are potentially good targets to study. In this study, we evaluated Indonesian medicinal plants for their anti-HCV activities.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) subgenotypes 1a and 1b have different impacts on the treatment response to peginterferon plus ribavirin with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) against patients infected with HCV genotype 1, as the emergence rates of resistance mutations are different between these two subgenotypes. In Japan, almost all of HCV genotype 1 belongs to subgenotype 1b.\",\"Telaprevir is an extremely potent antiviral drug. However, as with other direct-acting antiviral agents against the hepatitis C virus (HCV), this potency can be compromised by the rapid emergence of resistance mutations. This phenomenon is favored by the high rate of HCV replication, the lack of corrective activity to HCV polymerase errors, a low genetic barrier to resistance, and poor treatment adherence. Like other HCV protease inhibitors, telaprevir has a low genetic barrier to resistance. Phase II/III clinical trials (ADVANCE, ILLUMINATE and REALIZE) have characterized resistance to telaprevir in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin both genotypically and phenotypically. Mutations are selected mainly in positions 36, 54, 55, 155 and 156. The resistance profile depends on the genetic subtype of HCV, with selection of mutations in positions 36 and 155 for subtype 1a and in positions 36, 54, 55 and 156 for subtype 1b. The V36M+R155K and A156F/T/V variants confer a high degree of resistance (>25-fold increase), while the impact on resistance of other mutations such as V36A/G/M, T54A/S, R155G/K/M/T and A156S is lower (3-25- fold increase). The presence of polymorphisms or mutations associated with telaprevir resistance is very low (< 1%), especially for mutations with a higher impact on resistance. There is a high degree of cross resistance among protease inhibitors. However, the rapid reversion of telaprevir resistance mutations after the end of treatment could allow the use of \\\"recycling\\\" strategies with protease inhibitors.\",\"The introduction of telaprevir in the therapeutic armamentarium for hepatitis C virus infection is a major advance, even in patients unresponsive to prior treatment with interferon and ribavirin. In this group of patients, sustained viral response is achieved in more than 80% of those with recurrence and who received triple therapy. In partial responders, more than half achieve cure with the triple combination of pegylated interferon, ribavirin and telaprevir. Unfortunately, the results are less good in null responders, especially given that many are of a certain age and have advanced fibrosis. Patients in this group should be carefully selected to identify those most likely to derive a benefit from triple therapy.\",\"Chronic hepatitis due to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects nearly 180 million people worldwide. This infection is curable. Until 1 year ago, the only treatment for genotype 1 HCV was the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin, which was only moderately effective (40-50%). The introduction of new antiviral agents, such as telaprevir, represents a change of paradigm and has revolutionized the treatment of this infection. This drug has increased the likelihood of viral response (to 80%) and has allowed treatment length to be shortened in more than 50% of patients. New stopping rules have been developed to avoid the development of resistances. Finally, special attention should be paid to potentially serious adverse effects, particularly anemia and cutaneous alterations.\",\"Controversial results have been found in literature for the association between insulin resistance and sustained virologic response to standard chronic hepatitis C treatment. This study aims to provide a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, in order to evaluate if insulin resistance interferes with sustained virologic response in patients infected by the HCV genotype 1 versus HCV genotypes 2 and 3, undergoing treatment with interferon and ribavirin or pegylated interferon and ribavarin.\",\"Despite improved virologic response with the addition of direct acting agents to peginterferon and ribavirin treatment in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection, a subset of patients experience viral breakthrough while on therapy. Defining viral breakthrough and patient characteristics is important for ongoing and future HCV treatment.\",\"While ribavirin mono-therapy regimens have minimal effect on patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, they can be efficacious when combined with interferon. Clinical studies show that interferon-free combination therapies containing ribavirin are also efficacious, suggesting that an interferon-free therapy could be adopted in the near future. However, generation of drug resistant mutants and cross resistance to other drugs could impair the efficacy of the treatment. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of HCV resistance to ribavirin and cross resistance to other antiviral drugs could be of major importance.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents a leading worldwide medical and social problem. The expanding knowledge of HCV lifecycle has led to the development of novel antiviral agents that: a) specifically target a viral function (direct-acting antivirals), or b) specifically inhibit viral replication. The present review describes the novel anti-HCV drugs that have been better studied at the time of this writing and the current two types of treatment, namely interferon-based and interferon-free regimens. In addition, predictive factors, virological responses, side-effects, and resistance mechanisms of the novel agents are summarized.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most important problem across the world. It causes acute and chronic liver infection. Different approaches are in use to inhibit HCV infection, including small organic compounds, siRNA, shRNA and peptide inhibitors. This review article summarizes the current and future therapies for HCV infection. PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for articles published in English to give an insight into the current inhibitors against this life-threatening virus. HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors and nucleoside/nucleotide inhibitors of NS5B polymerase are presently in the most progressive stage of clinical development, but they are linked with the development of resistance and viral breakthrough. Boceprevir and telaprevir are the two most important protease inhibitors that have been approved recently for the treatment of HCV infection. These two drugs are now the part of standard-of-care treatment (SOC). There are also many other drugs in phase III of clinical development. When exploring the various host-cell-targeting compounds, the most hopeful results have been demonstrated by cyclophilin inhibitors. The current SOC treatment of HCV infection is Peg-interferon, ribavirin and protease inhibitors (boceprevir or telaprevir). The future treatment of this life-threatening disease must involve combinations of therapies hitting multiple targets of HCV and host factors. It is strongly expected that the near future, treatment of HCV infection will be a combination of direct-acting agents (DAA) without the involvement of interferon to eliminate its side effects.\",\"Reversibility of advanced fibrosis after HCV-clearance is an important goal of therapy.\",\"No therapeutics or vaccines currently exist for human coronaviruses (HCoVs). The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic in 2002-2003, and the recent emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in April 2012, emphasize the high probability of future zoonotic HCoV emergence causing severe and lethal human disease. Additionally, the resistance of SARS-CoV to ribavirin (RBV) demonstrates the need to define new targets for inhibition of CoV replication. CoVs express a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is required for high-fidelity replication and is conserved across the CoV family. All genetic and biochemical data support the hypothesis that nsp14-ExoN has an RNA proofreading function. Thus, we hypothesized that ExoN is responsible for CoV resistance to RNA mutagens. We demonstrate that while wild-type (ExoN+) CoVs were resistant to RBV and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), CoVs lacking ExoN activity (ExoN-) were up to 300-fold more sensitive. While the primary antiviral activity of RBV against CoVs was not mutagenesis, ExoN- CoVs treated with 5-FU demonstrated both enhanced sensitivity during multi-cycle replication, as well as decreased specific infectivity, consistent with 5-FU functioning as a mutagen. Comparison of full-genome next-generation sequencing of 5-FU treated SARS-CoV populations revealed a 16-fold increase in the number of mutations within the ExoN- population as compared to ExoN+. Ninety percent of these mutations represented A:G and U:C transitions, consistent with 5-FU incorporation during RNA synthesis. Together our results constitute direct evidence that CoV ExoN activity provides a critical proofreading function during virus replication. Furthermore, these studies identify ExoN as the first viral protein distinct from the RdRp that determines the sensitivity of RNA viruses to mutagens. Finally, our results show the importance of ExoN as a target for inhibition, and suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of ExoN activity could be potential pan-CoV therapeutics in combination with RBV or RNA mutagens.\",\"A novel reassortant avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus was isolated from respiratory specimens obtained from three patients and was identified as H7N9 in China. Antiviral agents are required to treat patients with avian influenza H7N9 virus infection.\",\"GS-9451 is a selective hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitor in development for the treatment of genotype 1 (GT1) HCV infection. Key preclinical properties of GS-9451, including in vitro antiviral activity, selectivity, cross-resistance, and combination activity, as well as pharmacokinetic properties, were determined. In multiple GT1a and GT1b replicon cell lines, GS-9451 had mean 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) of 13 and 5.4 nM, respectively, with minimal cytotoxicity; similar potency was observed in chimeric replicons encoding the NS3 protease gene of GT1 clinical isolates. GS-9451 was less active in GT2a replicon cells (EC50 = 316 nM). Additive to synergistic in vitro antiviral activity was observed when GS-9451 was combined with other agents, including alpha interferon, ribavirin, and the polymerase inhibitors GS-6620 and tegobuvir (GS-9190), as well as the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir (GS-5885). GS-9451 retained wild-type activity against multiple classes of NS5B and NS5A inhibitor resistance mutations. GS-9451 was stable in hepatic microsomes and hepatocytes from human and three other tested species. Systemic clearance was low in dogs and monkeys but high in rats. GS-9451 showed good oral bioavailability in all three species tested. In rats, GS-9451 levels were \\u223c40-fold higher in liver than plasma after intravenous dosing, and elimination of GS-9451 was primarily through biliary excretion. Together, these results are consistent with the antiviral activity observed in a recent phase 1b study. The results of in vitro cross-resistance and combination antiviral assays support the ongoing development of GS-9451 in combination with other agents for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.\",\"Chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major pandemic. The current standard of care includes peginterferon and ribavirin plus one of two protease inhibitors, boceprevir and telaprevir, for Genotype 1 patients and peginterferon and ribavirin for all other genotypes. The treatment landscape is rapidly evolving as a number of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) are being developed in clinical trials.\",\"Presently the development of new therapies for hepatitis C virus (HCV) is rapidly moving forward. Almost every week new data appear on how direct acting antivirals (DAAs) succeed or fail in clinical trials. Despite the potency of many of the DAA combinations, the effect exerted by ribavirin (RBV) is still needed for an effective therapy in many new DAA combinations. Due to the strong antiviral effect of DAAs, it is likely that a major complementary therapeutic effect exerted by RBV is immune modulation resulting in an increased barrier to development of resistance. For HCV genotype 1a infections elimination of pegylated interferon, is not possible in many DAA combinations without jeopardizing the results. The host immune response is thus likely to play a key role even during DAA-based therapies. Hence, T cells may recognize and eliminate viral variants with resistance to the DAAs. We herein show several examples where this may be the case, supporting the rationale of including the host response also in the new therapeutic regimens. This review will describe the potential benefits of combining various DAAs with means to activate the specific immune response against HCV.\",\"The HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is an essential enzyme in HCV viral replication and has been a prominent target in the search for therapies to treat individuals infected with HCV. The development of both nucleoside and nucleotide HCV inhibitors has been pursued because of their potential for showing pangenotypic activity and because of their high barrier to resistance. Even though nucleoside inhibitors were shown to be effective in a clinical setting, their potency limited their effectiveness. The exploitation of prodrug strategies to deliver nucleoside 5'-monophosphates has resulted in the development of a number of very potent inhibitors of HCV replication. In addition, several of these nucleotide prodrugs have demonstrated liver-targeting characteristics when administered orally. Human clinical studies have shown that a number of nucleotide prodrugs are potent inhibitors of viral replication leading to significant reductions in viral load when given orally. Combinations of these nucleotide prodrugs with either pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin or another direct acting antiviral alone has lead to cure rates as high as 100% after only 12 weeks of therapy. The combination of a nucleotide prodrug and another direct-acting antiviral agent holds the promise of delivering an interferon-free therapy for HCV patients thus eliminating the undesirable side effects associated with taking interferon.\",\"Faldaprevir (BI 201335) is a selective NS3/4A protease inhibitor under development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. NS3/4A genotyping and NS3 protease phenotyping analyses were performed to monitor the emergence of resistance in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection receiving faldaprevir alone or combined with pegylated interferon alfa 2a and ribavirin (PegIFN-RBV) during a phase 1b study. Among all baseline variants, a maximum 7-fold reduction in in vitro sensitivity to faldaprevir was observed for a rare NS3 (V/I)170T polymorphism. During faldaprevir monotherapy in treatment-naive patients, virologic breakthrough was common (77%, 20/26) and was associated with the emergence of resistance mutations predominantly carrying NS3 substitutions R155K in GT1a and D168V in GT1b. D168V conferred a greater reduction in faldaprevir sensitivity (1,800-fold) than R155K (330-fold); however, D168V was generally less fit than R155K in the absence of selective drug pressure. Treatment-experienced patients treated with faldaprevir-PegIFN-RBV triple therapy showed higher viral load reductions, lower rates of breakthrough (8%, 5/62), and less frequent emergence of resistance-associated variants compared with faldaprevir monotherapy. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT00793793.).\",\"GS-5885 is a novel hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor. In a 3-day monotherapy study in treatment-naive genotype 1a (GT1a) and GT1b HCV-infected subjects, median viral load reductions ranged from 2.3 to 3.3 log10 HCV RNA IU/ml across dosing cohorts (1, 3, 10, 30, or 90 mg once daily). Here, we report viral sequencing and phenotypic analysis of clinical isolates from this study. Detection of baseline NS5A amino acid substitutions at positions 28, 30, 31, or 93 in GT1a was associated with a reduced treatment response. In the GT1b cohort, Y93H was detected in 100% of subjects at day 4 or 14. In the Gt1a cohort, population sequencing detected NS5A resistance-associated mutations at day 4 or 14 for 3/10 subjects at the 1-mg dose and for all subjects dosed at \\u22653 mg. A subset of mutants that confer a low level of reduced susceptibility to GS-5885 was not detected by population sequencing at the 30- and 90-mg doses. Subject-derived M28T, Q30R, L31M, and Y93C mutations all conferred >30-fold reductions in GS-5885 and daclatasvir susceptibilities in vitro. Site-directed NS5A mutants also showed reduced susceptibility to GS-5885. However, all NS5A mutants tested remained fully susceptible to other classes of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), interferon alpha, and ribavirin. Importantly, the nonoverlapping resistance profile and high potency of GS-5885 support its further development with other direct-acting antivirals for the treatment of chronic HCV. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT01193478.).\",\"The addition of protease inhibitors, boceprevir or telaprevir, to peginterferon+ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) increases the frequency as well as the severity, and hence, clinical relevance of anemia, which has now become one of the major complications associated with triple therapy. Most significant factors associated with anemia in patients receiving triple therapy include older age, lower body mass index (BMI), advanced fibrosis, and lower baseline hemoglobin. The variability in inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) gene, which encodes a protein that hydrolyses inosine triphosphate (ITP), has been identified as an essential genetic factor for anemia both in dual and triple therapy. The correct management of anemia is based on anticipation, characterization and therapeutic management. Basically, anemia can be characterized in 3 types: ferropenic (mostly in fertile women), thalassemic type hemolytic anemia, and anemia from chronic processes. Functional deficit of iron should also be excluded in patients with normal ferritin and lower saturation of transferrin. Ribavirin dose reduction and epoetin, sequentially, are indicated in the management of anemia. Epoetin non-response can be caused by lack of time, type of anemia, functional iron deficit or erythropoietin resistance. In the transplantation setting, adding a protease inhibitor to PegIFN/RBV results in a significant increase in the incidence and severity of anemia and, as a consequence, a greater need for epoetin, transfusions, and ribavirin dose reductions. Packed red cell transfusions are utilized when hemoglobin decreases to less than 7.5g/dl and/or there are clinical symptoms and/or there is no response to other therapeutic measures.\",\"More than two decades of intense research has provided a detailed understanding of hepatitis C virus (HCV), which chronically infects 2% of the world's population. This effort has paved the way for the development of antiviral compounds to spare patients from life-threatening liver disease. An exciting new era in HCV therapy dawned with the recent approval of two viral protease inhibitors, used in combination with pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin; however, this is just the beginning. Multiple classes of antivirals with distinct targets promise highly efficient combinations, and interferon-free regimens with short treatment duration and fewer side effects are the future of HCV therapy. Ongoing and future trials will determine the best antiviral combinations and whether the current seemingly rich pipeline is sufficient for successful treatment of all patients in the face of major challenges, such as HCV diversity, viral resistance, the influence of host genetics, advanced liver disease and other co-morbidities.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the foremost causes of chronic liver disease affecting over 300 million globally. HCV contains a positive-stranded RNA of ~9600 nt and is surrounded by the 5' and 3'untranslated regions (UTR). The only successful treatment regimen includes interferon (IFN) and ribavirin. Like many other viruses, HCV has also evolved various mechanisms to circumvent the IFN response by blocking (1) downstream signaling actions via STAT1, STAT2, IRF9 and JAK-STAT pathways and (2) repertoire of IFN Stimulatory Genes (ISGs). Several studies have identified complex host demographic and genetic factors as well as viral genetic heterogeneity associated with outcomes of IFN therapy. The genetic predispositions of over 2000 ISGS may render the patients to become resistant, thus identification of such parameters within a subset of population are necessary for management corollary. The ability of various HCV genotypes to diminish IFN antiviral responses plays critical role in the establishment of chronic infection at the acute stage of infection, thus highlighting importance of the resistance in HCV treated groups. The recently defined role of viral protein such as C, E2, NS3/NS4 and NS5A proteins in inducing the IFN resistance are discussed in this article. How the viral and host genetic composition and epistatic connectivity among polymorphic genomic sites synchronizes the evolutionary IFN resistance trend remains under investigation. However, these signals may have the potential to be employed for accurate prediction of therapeutic outcomes. In this review article, we accentuate the significance of host and viral components in IFN resistance with the aim to determine the successful outcome in patients.\",\"Combination of several direct-acting antiviral agents will be necessary to overcome viral resistance in interferon-free treatment regimens for chronic HCV infection. HCV p7 inhibitors may be part of such combination regimens. Understanding why amantadine, despite showing inhibition of HCV p7 in vitro, appears ineffective in clinical trials, may help in the design of novel HCV p7 inhibitors. So far it is unknown whether viral escape mutations within HCV p7 explain the ineffectiveness of amantadine in vivo.\",\"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly contagious pathogen that infects mainly ciliated cells of respiratory epithelium and type 1 pneumocytes in the alveoli frequently causing serious respiratory disease in infants, elderly, and immunocompromised patients. At present, prevention/treatment of RSV infection is limited to the use of specific anti-RSV antibody or an aerosol formulation of ribavirin, a drug of suboptimal efficacy and low safety profile. There is an urgent need for development of novel anti-RSV drugs and virucides. Here we describe the cell culture-based methods used in our laboratory in identification of novel inhibitors of RSV including the P13 fusion inhibitor, and the PG545 virucide. Protocols for antiviral screening, evaluation of anti-RSV potency, and elucidation of mode of antiviral activity of test compounds are described.\",\"The current standard of care (SOC) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-infected patients consists of telaprevir or boceprevir in addition to pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment. Other selective inhibitors of HCV replication are being developed. Drug pressure may, depending on the class of inhibitors, (rapidly) select for drug-resistant variants. Here we describe four different approaches to select in vitro for drug-resistant HCV subgenomic replicons.\",\"Asunaprevir is a selective NS3 protease inhibitor with in vitro activity against HCV genotypes 1 and 4.\",\"RNA viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), have markedly error-prone replication, resulting in high rates of mutagenesis. In addition, the standard treatment includes ribavirin, a base analog that is likely to cause mutations in different regions of the HCV genome, resulting in deleterious effects on HCV itself. The N-terminal region of the core protein is reported to block interferon (IFN) signaling by interaction with the STAT1\\u2011SH2 domain, resulting in HCV resistance to IFN therapy. In this study, mutations in the HCV core protein from IFN/ribavirin\\u2011treated patients were analyzed, with particular focus on the N\\u2011terminal domain of the HCV core which is reported to interact with STAT1. HCV PCR positive patients enrolled in this study were either undergoing pegylated IFN/ribavirin bitherapy and had completed 12 weeks of initial treatment or were treatment\\u2011na\\u00efve patients. The HCV core protein was cloned and sequenced from these patients and mutations observed in the STAT1\\u2011interacting domain of the core protein from treated patients were characterized using in silico interaction to depict the role of these mutations in disease outcomes. Our results suggest that the amino acids at positions 2, 3, 8, 16 and 23 of the HCV core protein are critical for core-STAT1 interaction and ribavirin-induced mutations at these positions interfere with the interaction, resulting in a better response of the treated patients. In conclusion, this study anticipates that HCV core residues 2, 3, 8, 16 and 23 directly interact with STAT1. We propose that IFN/ribavirin bitherapy\\u2011induced mutations in the STAT1\\u2011interacting domain of the HCV core protein may be responsible for the improved therapeutic response and viral clearance, thus amino acids 1-23 of the N-terminus of the core protein are an ideal antiviral target. However, this treatment may give rise to resistant variants that are able to escape the current therapy. We propose similar studies in responsive and non-responsive genotypes in order to gain a broader picture of this proposed mechanism of viral clearance.\",\"Many challenges exist for the study of HCV in the laboratory. Therapy using interferon (IFN) is expensive, not well tolerated and ineffective for many patients. HCV research has been hampered by the lack of a robust tissue culture system, but recent advances have made virus growth in culture possible. Cell culture systems using genetically engineered viruses have been reviewed extensively, but here we review recent advances made in the use of natural isolates and the molecular challenges that have been used to overcome the limitations in their growth. Six major genotypes have been identified for HCV that are further divided into numerous subtypes. Combination therapy utilizing IFN-\\u03b1 and ribavirin is the standard of care, but is successful in only one-half of patients. The reasons for IFN resistance may be viral- or host-related and may be due to multiple factors. Recently, telaprevir and boceprevir, together with IFN-\\u03b1 and ribavirin, have been added to the standard of care in patients infected with IFN-resistant genotypes. A major obstacle in the development of effective vaccines and improved therapeutics has been the lack of a reproducible and efficient tissue culture system for propagation of HCV. Many cell culture systems have used genetically-engineered viruses to gain growth in culture through the use of replicons, but recent advances using natural isolates may improve the outlook for progress in HCV research.\",\"Host cell lipid rafts form a scaffold required for replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Serine palmitoyltransferases (SPTs) produce sphingolipids, which are essential components of the lipid rafts that associate with HCV nonstructural proteins. Prevention of the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids by an SPT inhibitor disrupts the HCV replication complex and thereby inhibits HCV replication. We investigated the ability of the SPT inhibitor NA808 to prevent HCV replication in cells and mice.\",\"Colorectal cancer cells exhibit limited cytotoxicity towards Tiazofurin, a pro-drug metabolized by cytosolic nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase2 (NMNAT2) to thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide, a potent inhibitor of inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase required for cellular guanylate synthesis. We tested the hypothesis that colorectal cancer cells that exhibit low levels of NMNAT2 and are refractory to Tiazofurin can be rendered sensitive to Tiazofurin by overexpressing NMNAT2. Transfection of hNMNAT2 resulted in a six- and threefold cytoplasmic overexpression in Caco2 and HT29 cell lines correlating with Tiazofurin-induced enhanced cell-kill. Folate receptors expressed on the cell surface of 30-50% colorectal carcinomas were exploited for cellular targeting with Tiazofurin encapsulated in folate-tethered nanoparticles. Our results indicated that in wild-type colorectal cancer cells, free Tiazofurin-induced EC50 cell-kill was 1500-2000 \\u03bcM, which was reduced to 66-156 \\u03bcM in hNMNAT2-overexpressed cells treated with Tiazofurin encapsulated in non-targeted nanoparticles. This efficacy was improved threefold by encapsulating Tiazofurin in folate-tethered nanoparticles to obtain an EC(50) cell-kill of 22-59 \\u03bcM, an equivalent of 100-300 mg m(-2) (one-tenth of the approved dose of Tiazofurin in humans), which will result in minimal toxicity leading to cancer cell-kill. This proof-of-principle study suggests that resistance of colorectal cancer cell-kill to Tiazofurin can be overcome by sequentially overexpressing hNMNAT2 and then facilitating the uptake of Tiazofurin by folate-tethered nanoparticles, which enter cells via folate receptors.\",\"Vaniprevir with P/R improved SVR rates over P/R alone in treatment-experienced patients with chronic HCV-genotype 1 infection, but treatment failure presents therapeutic challenges. We identified RAVs from non-cirrhotic patients failing to achieve SVR on vaniprevir-containing regimens from a dose/duration-ranging trial of triple-combination therapy.\",\"Vaniprevir is a competitive inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease that has potent anti-HCV activity in preclinical models. This placebo-controlled dose-ranging study assessed the safety, tolerability, and antiviral efficacy of vaniprevir monotherapy in patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV infection. Treatment-naive and treatment-experienced non-cirrhotic adult patients with baseline HCV RNA >10(6)IU/ml were randomized to receive placebo or vaniprevir at doses of 125 mg qd, 600 mg qd, 25mg bid, 75 mg bid, 250 mg bid, 500 mg bid, and 700 mg bid for 8 days. Forty patients (82.5% male, 75% genotype 1a) received at least one dose of placebo or vaniprevir. After 1 week of vaniprevir, the decrease in HCV RNA from baseline ranged from 1.8 to 4.6 log10IU/ml across all treatment groups, and there was a greater than dose-proportional increase in vaniprevir exposure at doses above 75 mg bid. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (n=5) and nausea (n=5). No pattern of laboratory or ECG abnormalities was observed, all AEs resolved during the study, and there were no discontinuations due to AEs. No serious AEs were reported. Resistance-associated amino acid variants were identified at positions R155 and D168 in patients infected with genotype 1a virus. Vaniprevir monotherapy demonstrated potent antiviral activity in patients with chronic genotype 1 HCV infection, and was generally well tolerated with no serious AEs or discontinuations due to AEs. Further development of vaniprevir, including studies in combination with other anti-HCV agents, is ongoing.\",\"The introduction of direct-acting anti-virals has increased sustained virological response (SVR) rates in chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection.

To date, the standard of care is a combination of pegylated interferon-alpha with ribavirin, and recently two direct acting antivirals have entered the clinics. However, because of side effects, drug resistance and viral genotype-specific differences in efficacy current and potentially also future therapies have their limitations. Here, we describe the development of a phenotypic high-throughput assay to identify new cross-genotype inhibitors with novel mechanism of action, by combining a genotype (gt) 1 replicon with the infectious HCV gt2 cell culture system. To develop this phenotypic multiplex assay, HCV reporter cells expressing RFP-NLS-IPS and gt1b replicon cells expressing NS5A-GFP were co-plated and treated with compounds followed by inoculation with gt2a HCV. At 72h post treatment, RFP translocation as a marker for HCV infection and GFP fluorescence intensity as a marker for gt1 RNA replication were measured. Additionally, the total cell number, which serves as an indicator of cytotoxicity, was determined. This phenotypic strategy supports multi-parameter data acquisition from a single well to access cross-genotypic activity, provides an indication of the stage of the viral life cycle targeted, and also assesses compound cytotoxicity. Taken together, this multiplex phenotypic platform facilitates the identification of novel compounds for drug development and chemical probes for continuing efforts to understand the HCV life cycle.\",\"HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection affects an estimated 180 million people in the world's population. Adverse effects occur frequently with current standard treatment of interferon and ribavirin, while resistance of new direct anti-viral agents, NS3 protease inhibitors, is a major concern because of their single anti-HCV mechanism against the viral factor. New anti-viral agents are needed to resolve the problems. Amiodarone, an anti-arrhythmic drug, has recently been shown to inhibit HCV infection in vitro. The detailed mechanism has yet to be clarified. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory effect of amiodarone on HCV life cycle. The effect of amiodarone on HCV life cycle was investigated in Huh-7.5.1 cells with HCVcc (cell culture-derived HCV), HCVpp (HCV pseudoviral particles), sub-genomic replicons, IRES (internal ribosomal entry site)-mediated translation assay, and intracellular and extracellular infectivity assays. The administration of amiodarone appeared to inhibit HCV entry independent of genotypes, which was attributed to the down-regulation of CD81 receptor expression. The inhibitory effect of amiodarone also manifested in the HCV assembly step, via the suppression of MTP (microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein) activity. Amiodarone revealed no effects on HCV replication and translation. With the host factor-targeting characteristics, amiodarone may be an attractive agent for the treatment of HCV infection.\",\"Genetic polymorphisms observed in various disease states associated with sensitivity or resistance to specific treatments have been a robust area of investigation for decades, with the potential to allow clinicians to make evidence-based decisions on the appropriate course of treatment. This study aimed to evaluate whether genetic polymorphisms of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 gene (STAT6) could be associated with a sustained virological response (SVR) among patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotypes 1 and 2 (HCV-1 and HCV-2) who were treated with peginterferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFN\\u03b1-RBV). We analyzed the associations between SVR to PEG-IFN\\u03b1-RBV therapy and 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in STAT6. This study included Taiwanese Chinese patients infected with either HCV-1 (n = 265) or HCV-2 (n = 195) in the presence or absence of an SVR. Among the STAT6 SNPs examined, the dosage effect of the A allele and allele frequency in rs1059513 were inversely correlated with SVR in patients infected with HCV-1 (P = 0.0179 and P = 0.0235, respectively). This effect was not observed in patients infected with HCV-2. The GG, GGG, and GGGC STAT6 haplotypes comprising 2, 3, and 4 SNPs (rs1059513, rs703817, rs324015, and rs3024974) were found to be associated with SVR, and their presence may increase the probability of a successful treatment outcome in patients infected with HCV-1 (P = 0.0273, 0.0352, and 0.0368, respectively). Moreover, a multivariate logistic regression model for predicting an SVR revealed that the presence of the GGGC haplotype carriers mutually affected the outcome of PEG-IFN\\u03b1-RBV treatment. The presence of STAT6 SNPs and the association with SVR demonstrated that STAT6 polymorphisms might influence the therapeutic outcomes of patients infected with HCV-1 under standard-of-care (SOC) treatment.\",\"Study C209 evaluated the activity of telaprevir in treatment-na\\u00efve patients with genotypes 2 or 3 (G2, G3) hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Telaprevir monotherapy showed potent activity against HCV G2, but limited activity against G3. This analysis was performed to characterize HCV viral variants emerging during telaprevir-based treatment of G2/G3 HCV-infected patients. Patients were randomized to receive 2 weeks of treatment with telaprevir (telaprevir monotherapy), telaprevir plus peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin (triple therapy), or placebo plus peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin (control), followed by 22-24 weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin alone. Viral breakthrough was defined as an increase >1 log10 in HCV RNA from nadir, or HCV RNA >100 IU/mL in patients previously reaching <25 IU/mL. Twenty-three patients (47%) had G2 and 26 (53%) had G3 HCV. Viral breakthrough occurred during the initial 2-week treatment phase in six G2 patients (66.7%; subtypes 2, 2a and 2b) and three G3 patients (37.5%; all subtype 3a), all in the telaprevir monotherapy arm. Four breakthrough patients (three G2, one G3) subsequently achieved sustained virologic response (SVR). In all patients with breakthrough and available sequence data, mutations associated with reduced susceptibility to telaprevir in genotype 1 (G1) HCV were observed. No novel G2/G3-specific mutations were associated with telaprevir resistance. The telaprevir resistance profile appeared consistent across HCV genotypes 1, 2 and 3. Although viral breakthrough with resistance occurred in patients receiving telaprevir monotherapy, half of these patients achieved an SVR upon addition of peginterferon/ribavirin highlighting the importance of combination therapy.\",\"Achievement of early viral suppression is important in patients with chronic HCV infection treated with telaprevir (TLV) or boceprevir (BOC) to avoid selection of drug resistance and attain cure. No head-to-head studies comparing TLV and BOC have been performed so far.\",\"Cell culture-produced hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been subjected to up to 100 serial passages in human hepatoma cells in the absence or presence of different doses of alpha interferon (IFN-\\u03b1). Virus survival, genetic changes, fitness levels, and phenotypic traits have been examined. While high initial IFN-\\u03b1 doses (increasing from 1 to 4 IU/ml) did not allow HCV survival beyond passage 40, a gradual exposure (from 0.25 to 10 IU/ml) allowed the virus to survive for at least 100 passages. The virus passaged in the presence of IFN-\\u03b1 acquired IFN-\\u03b1 resistance as evidenced by enhanced progeny production and viral protein expression in an IFN-\\u03b1 environment. A partial IFN-\\u03b1 resistance was also noted in populations passaged in the absence of IFN-\\u03b1. All lineages acquired adaptative mutations, and multiple, nonsynonymous mutations scattered throughout the genome were present in IFN-\\u03b1-selected populations. Comparison of consensus sequences indicates a dominance of synonymous versus nonsynonymous substitutions. IFN-\\u03b1-resistant populations displayed decreased sensitivity to a combination of IFN-\\u03b1 and ribavirin. A phenotypic trait common to all assayed viral populations is the ability to increase shutoff host cell protein synthesis, accentuated in infections with IFN-\\u03b1-selected populations carried out in the presence of IFN-\\u03b1. The trait was associated with enhanced phosphorylation of protein kinase R (PKR) and eIF2\\u03b1, although other contributing factors are likely. The results suggest that multiple, independent mutational pathways can confer IFN-\\u03b1 resistance to HCV and might explain why no unified picture has been obtained regarding IFN-\\u03b1 resistance in vivo.\",\"Several HCV polymerase inhibitors are in advanced stages of clinical development. They are nucleos(t)ide and non-nucleoside analogs. Nucleos(t)ides inhibit viral replication acting as chain terminators whereas non-nucleosides block allosterically the HCV polymerase. Sofosbuvir is an uridine analog and currently the most promising HCV polymerase inhibitor, being active across all HCV genotypes. It has good tolerability and a robust barrier to resistance. In contrast, non-nucleoside analogs have low to moderate antiviral potency, a low barrier to resistance and inhibit only HCV genotype 1.\",\"The clinical correlation between hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A gene mutations and response to antiviral treatment in HCV-3a-infected patients is not as well known as that in HCV-1a-infected and HCV-1b-infected patients.\",\"Considering the similarities between the transcriptional programming involved in cancer progression and somatic cell reprogramming, we tried to identify drugs that would be effective against malignant cancers. We used the early transposon Oct4 and Sox2 enhancer (EOS) system to select human prostate cancer (PCA) cells expressing high levels of OCT4. Patients with metastatic castration-resistant PCA that does not respond to treatment with docetaxel have few therapeutic options. The OCT4-expressing PCA cells selected using the EOS system showed increased tumorigenicity and high resistance to docetaxel, both in vitro and in vivo. By using their gene expression data, expression signature-based prediction for compound candidates identified an antiviral drug, ribavirin, as a conversion modulator from drug resistance to sensitivity. Treatment of PCA cells with ribavirin decreased their resistance against treatment with docetaxel. This indicated that ribavirin reversed the gene expression, including that of humoral factors, in the OCT4-expressing PCA cells selected using the EOS system. Thereby, ribavirin increased the efficacy of docetaxel for cancer cells. We propose a novel cell reprogramming approach, named drug efficacy reprogramming, as a new model for identifying candidate antitumor drugs.\",\"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects an estimated 150 million people worldwide and is the major cause of viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. The available antiviral therapies, which include PEGylated interferon, ribavirin, and one of the HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors telaprevir or boceprevir, are ineffective for some patients and cause severe side effects. More potent NS3/4A protease inhibitors are in clinical development, but the long-term effectiveness of these drugs is challenged by the development of drug resistance. Here, we investigated the role of macrocycles in the susceptibility of NS3/4A protease inhibitors to drug resistance in asunaprevir, danoprevir, vaniprevir, and MK-5172, with similar core structures but varied P2 moieties and macrocyclizations. Linear and macrocyclic analogues of these drugs were designed, synthesized, and tested against wild-type and drug-resistant variants R155K, V36M/R155K, A156T, and D168A in enzymatic and antiviral assays. Macrocyclic inhibitors were generally more potent, but the location of the macrocycle was critical for retaining activity against drug-resistant variants: the P1-P3 macrocyclic inhibitors were less susceptible to drug resistance than the linear and P2-P4 macrocyclic analogues. In addition, the heterocyclic moiety at P2 largely determined the inhibitor resistance profile, susceptibility to drug resistance, and the extent of modulation by the helicase domain. Our findings suggest that to design robust inhibitors that retain potency to drug-resistant NS3/4A protease variants, inhibitors should combine P1-P3 macrocycles with flexible P2 moieties that optimally contact with the invariable catalytic triad of this enzyme.\",\"Using ultra-deep sequencing technology, the present was designed to investigate whether the emergence of telaprevir-resistant variants (amino acid substitutions of aa36, aa54, aa155, aa156, and aa170 positions in HCV NS3 region) after commencement of triple therapy of telaprevir/peginterferon (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin could be predicted at baseline in previous non-responders to dual therapy. Fourteen patients infected with HCV genotype 1 who did not respond to previous PEG-IFN/ribavirin, received a 24-week regimen of triple therapy, and were evaluated for appearance of telaprevir-resistant variants (amino acid substitutions of more than 0.2% among the total coverage) by ultra-deep sequencing. The sustained virological response rate was 28.6% (4 of 14 patients), which was significantly higher in patients with Arg70 (substitution at core aa70) and partial response (type of previous response to PEG-IFN/ribavirin) than in other patients. Telaprevir-resistant variants at baseline were detected in 7.1% (1 of 14 patients) by direct sequencing and in 21.4% (3 of 14 patients) by ultra-deep sequencing. The appearance of telaprevir-resistant variants was examined by ultra-deep sequencing in 10 who did not show sustained virological responders. De novo variants emerged at re-elevation of viral load, regardless of variant frequencies at baseline (one patient with very high frequency variants [T54S: 99.9%], two patients with very low frequency variants [V36A: 0.2%; and V170A: 0.4%], and seven patients of undetectable variants). It is concluded that it is difficult to predict at baseline the emergence of telaprevir-resistant variants after commencement of triple therapy in prior non-responders of HCV genotype 1, even with the use of ultra-deep sequencing.\",\"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of livestock caused by a highly variable RNA virus (FMDV) that has seven serotypes and more than sixty subtypes. Both prophylactic and post-infection means of controlling the disease outbreak, including universally applicable vaccines and emergency response measures such as therapeutic treatments, are on high demand. In this study, we analyzed the long-term exposure outcome to a previously identified inhibitor of 3D polymerase (FMDV 3Dpol) for controlling FMDV infection and for the selection of resistance mutants. The results showed that no escape mutant viruses were isolated from FMDV A24 Cruzeiro infections in cell culture treated with gradually increasing concentrations of the antiviral compound 5D9 (4-chloro-N'-thieno, [2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ylbenzenesulfonohydrazide) over ten passages. Biochemical and plaque assays revealed that when 5D9 was used at concentrations within a non-toxic range in cells, it drove the virus to undetectable levels at passage eight to ten. This is in contrast with observations made on parallel control (untreated) passages exhibiting fully viable and stable virus progenies. Collectively, the results demonstrated that under the experimental conditions, treatment with 5D9 does not confer a resistant phenotype and the virus is unable to evade the antiviral effect of the inhibitor. Further efforts using quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) based modifications of the 5D9 compound may result in the successful development of an effective in vivo antiviral drug targeting FMDV.\",\"Even though new drugs have been approved for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the risk of drug-drug interactions and concern about overlapping toxicities has hindered the development of studies in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals. Traditional treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (peg-IFN + RBV) is very expensive and has a low rate of sustained virological response in coinfected patients, especially if they are infected with HCV genotype 1. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is a drug that is being evaluated for the treatment of chronic HCV infection, both in HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Understanding the NTZ resistance mechanism could allow the development of resistance to be minimized and would expand the treatment options, mainly in special populations such as HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Similarly to IFN, NTZ increases the activity of the cellular protein kinase activated by double-stranded RNA (PKR), a key kinase in the innate antiviral response. In order to elucidate whether sequence heterogeneity in the PKR-binding domain of HCV NS5A genotype 1 could influence the antiviral activity of either NTZ monotherapy or peg-IFN + RBV, baseline and end-of-therapy plasma samples from two groups of eleven non-responder HIV/HCV-coinfected patients that had received NTZ or peg-IFN + RBV were studied. Most of the HCV NS5A sequences examined at the end of therapy did not change from the baseline, even after 30 days course of antiviral therapy. An extensive comparison of HCV NS5A genotype 1 and 4 sequences from the database with reported IFN therapy outcome was performed in order to infer their phylogenetic relationships. The HCV genotype 1 NS5A nucleotide sequences from therapy-non-responder patients were intermingled amongst those from the database, irrespective of their IFN-therapy outcome. When comparing NS5A-PKRBD amino acid sequences, significant differences were observed in genotype 4, but not in genotype 1 (p < 0.0001 and p > 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, despite IFN and NTZ sharing the protein kinase activated by double-stranded RNA as their cellular target, the HCV genotype 1 strategy to counteract the IFN action mediated by NS5A ISDR/PKRBD does not explain drug resistance in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Other viral factors that are possibly involved are discussed as well.\",\"This article provides an unbiased review of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and drug-drug interaction data of telaprevir, an NS3/4A protease inhibitor. Telaprevir is well absorbed with fatty food, moderately protein bound (59-76 %) with a large volume of distribution (~252 L), primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein, and is largely excreted into feces. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters are well described in healthy subjects and individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), although only limited data are available in specific patient subpopulations. Telaprevir is recommended to be given at 750 mg by mouth every 8 h for 12 weeks, in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin (the standard care). The addition of telaprevir to the standard care regimen results in increased sustained virological response in treatment-na\\u00efve patients (30 %) and treatment-experienced patients (up to 50 %), and works synergistically to lower viral resistance. Telaprevir is a substrate and/or inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, and drug-drug interaction studies in humans have focused on these pathways. Based on our analysis, a few reported drug-drug interactions may be classified as clinically significant, but more experiments under dosing conditions that resemble those given in the clinic are needed to understand the relevance of some of the reported interactions. Future studies should focus on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of telaprevir in special populations or patients with concomitant conditions that will likely co-exist with HCV infection, with an emphasis on establishing pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships. In vitro characterization of other phase 1-3 metabolic pathways could assist in elucidating the mechanisms of the drug-drug interactions observed in humans.\",\"Ribavirin (RBV) is often used in conjunction with interferon-based therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis C. There is a drastic difference in the anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity of RBV between the HuH-7-derived assay system, OR6, possessing the RBV-resistant phenotype (50% effective concentration [EC50 ]: >100 \\u00b5M) and the recently discovered Li23-derived assay system, ORL8, possessing the RBV-sensitive phenotype (EC50 : 8 \\u00b5M; clinically achievable concentration). This is because the anti-HCV activity of RBV was mediated by the inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase in RBV-sensitive ORL8 cells harboring HCV RNA. By means of comparative analyses using RBV-resistant OR6 cells and RBV-sensitive ORL8 cells, we tried to identify host factor(s) determining the anti-HCV activity of RBV. We found that the expression of adenosine kinase (ADK) in ORL8 cells was significantly higher than that in RBV-resistant OR6 cells harboring HCV RNA. Ectopic ADK expression in OR6 cells converted them from an RBV-resistant to an RBV-sensitive phenotype, and inhibition of ADK abolished the activity of RBV. We showed that the differential ADK expression between ORL8 and OR6 cells was not the result of genetic polymorphisms in the ADK gene promoter region and was not mediated by a microRNA control mechanism. We found that the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of ADK messenger RNA in ORL8 cells was longer than that in OR6 cells, and that only a long 5' UTR possessed internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity. Finally, we demonstrated that the long 5' UTR functioned as an IRES in primary human hepatocytes.\",\"Lipid pathway impairment, decrease in the antioxidant pool and downregulation in amino-acid metabolism are just some of the metabolic variations attributed to chronic HCV infection. All of them have been studied separately, mainly in animal models. Thanks to proteomic analysis we managed to describe (for the fist time to the best of our knowledge), in vivo and in humans, the metabolic alterations caused by HCV, and the recovery of the same alterations during HCV treatment. We performed proteomic analysis on liver specimens of a 28-year-old woman affected by hepatitis C genotype 1a, alcoholism and diabetes mellitus type 1, before and after antiviral treatment with pegylated interferon alpha 2b and ribavirin. The subject, thanks to a patient-tailored therapy, reached Sustained Virological Response. Throughout the treatment period the patient was monitored with subsequent biochemical, clinical and psychological examinations. The data obtained by the patient's close monitoring suggest a direct interaction between insulin resistance and an active HCV genotype 1 infection, with a leading role played by the infection, and not by insulin resistance, as demonstrated by the sharp fall of the insulin units needed per day during treatment. The proteomic analysis showed that after therapy, a downregulation of enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and alcohol catabolism takes place, the latter probably due to cessation of alcohol abuse. On the contrary, the metabolic pathways linked to metabolism of the reactive oxygen species were upregulated after therapy. Finally, a significant alteration in the pathway regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA), a major regulator of lipid metabolism in the liver, was reported. These \\\"real time\\\" data confirm in vivo, in humans, that during HCV infection, the pathways related to fatty acids, glucose metabolism and free radical scavenging are inhibited. The same enzyme deficit is completely recovered after HCV eradication.\",\"Insulin resistance (IR) is a key factor in the development of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Little is known about the impact of viral clearance on IR.\",\"In a sentinel cohort, hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients (primarily genotype [GT] 1a) were treated with daclatasvir (NS5A inhibitor) and asunaprevir (NS3 protease inhibitor). Preexistence, emergence, and persistence of resistance variants in patients who failed this treatment are described. HCV-infected null responders received daclatasvir (60 mg once daily) and asunaprevir (600 mg twice daily) alone (Group A, 11 patients) or with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin (Group B, 10 patients) for 24 weeks. Resistance testing was performed on baseline samples and samples with HCV RNA \\u22651,000 IU/mL at Week 1 through posttreatment Week 48. Resistance substitution susceptibility to inhibition by asunaprevir and daclatasvir was assessed using HCV replicon assays. In Group A, six GT1a patients experiencing viral breakthrough and one GT1a patient who relapsed had detectable NS5A (Q30E/R, L31V/M, Y93C/N) and NS3 (R155K, D168A/E/V/Y) resistance-associated variants at failure. Two of six viral breakthrough patients achieved SVR48 after treatment intensification with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin. For 2/4 viral breakthrough patients not responding to treatment intensification, NS3 resistance variants changed (D168Y to D168T; R155K to V36M-R155K). At posttreatment Week 48, daclatasvir-resistant variants persisted while asunaprevir-resistant variants were generally replaced by wild-type sequences. The NS3 sequence remained unchanged in the one patient with NS3-R155K at baseline, relapse, and posttreatment Week 48. In Group B, no viral breakthrough was observed.\",\"Protease inhibitors have improved treatment of infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), but dosing, a low barrier to resistance, drug interactions, and side-effects restrict their use. We assessed the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir, a uridine nucleotide analogue, in treatment-naive patients with genotype 1-3 HCV infection.\",\"Since the discovery of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), a plethora of experimental models have evolved, allowing the virus's life cycle and the pathogenesis of associated liver diseases to be investigated. These models range from inoculation of cultured cells with serum from patients with hepatitis C to the use of surrogate models for the study of specific stages of the HCV life cycle: retroviral pseudoparticles for the study of HCV entry, replicons for the study of HCV replication, and the HCV cell culture model, which reproduces the entire life cycle (replication and production of infectious particles). The use of these tools has been and remains crucial to identify potential therapeutic targets in the different stages of the virus's life cycle and to screen new antiviral drugs. A clear example is the recent approval of two viral protease inhibitors (boceprevir and telaprevir) in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. This review analyzes the advances made in the molecular biology of HCV and highlights possible candidates as therapeutic targets for the treatment of HCV infection.\",\"The development of novel direct antiviral agents (DAAs) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) has represented a breakthrough in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Telaprevir and boceprevir are the first two protease inhibitor (PI) DAAs to be approved for combination therapy with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). In genotype 1 monoinfected patients, triple PI therapy has increased sustained viral response (SVR) rates by approximately 30% compared with conventional combination therapy. The introduction of these drugs into clinical practice will modify the timing of monitoring parameters in diagnostic laboratories, especially with regard to stopping rules and to faster delivery of results. In the near future, new DAAs, directed against different targets of the HCV cycle (polymerase inhibitors, viral replication complex inhibitors and cyclophilin inhibitors), which are currently in various stages of clinical development, will be available. Some of these DAAs have already reached advanced phases of development, both in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV and in interferon-free therapy, with very high rates of SVR.\",\"Most direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that are being developed as therapy against hepatitis C virus target the NS3/4A protease, the NS5A protein, and the NS5B polymerase. The latter enzyme offers different target sites: the catalytic domain for nucleos(t)ide analogues as well as a number of allosteric sites for nonnucleos(t)ide inhibitors. Two NS3/4A protease inhibitors have been approved recently, and more than 40 new NS3/4A, NS5A, or NS5B inhibitors are in development. These agents can achieve very high cure rates when combined with pegylated interferon-\\u03b2 and ribavirin and show promising clinical results when administered in all-oral combinations. In addition to the more canonical drug targets, new alternative viral targets for small-molecule drug development are emerging, such as p7 or NS4B and viral entry. Future research will need to define well-tolerated and cost-effective DAA combinations that provide the highest rates of viral eradication in all patients (including those with advanced liver disease), the broadest spectrum of action on viral genotypes showing minimal or no clinical resistance, and the shortest treatment duration.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has major health impact worldwide and is a significant cause of chronic liver disease. In Egypt, HCV is highly endemic (up to 15% of the population); 91% of the patients are infected with genotype 4. Searching for new predictors of response to therapy is mandatory to decrease the cost and the adverse effects of current therapy.\",\"Two classes of hepatitis C antiviral agents currently exist, i.e., direct-acting antivirals and host-targeting antivirals. Direct-acting antivirals target viral proteins including NS3/NS4A protease, NS5B polymerase and NS5A protein, while host-targeting antivirals target various host proteins critical for replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Alisporivir is the most advanced host-targeting antiviral in clinical development. Alisporivir blocks HCV replication by neutralizing the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of the abundant host cytosolic protein, cyclophilin A. Due to its unique mechanism of antiviral action, alisporivir is pangenotypic, provides a high barrier for development of viral resistance, and does not permit cross-resistance to direct-acting antivirals. Alisporivir has an excellent pharmacokinetic and safety profile. Phase I and II clinical studies have demonstrated that alisporivir causes a dramatic reduction in viral loads in HCV-infected patients. Alisporivir was shown to be highly potent in treatment-na\\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients with genotype 1 as well as in those with genotypes 2 or 3. Low viral breakthrough rates were observed and the most frequent clinical and laboratory adverse events associated with alisporivir in combination with pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin were similar to those associated with pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin used alone. A laboratory abnormality observed in some patients receiving alisporivir is hyperbilirubinemia, which is related to transporter inhibition and not to liver toxicity. The most recent clinical results suggest that alisporivir plus other direct-acting antivirals should provide a successful treatment option for difficult-to-treat populations, such as nonresponders to prior interferon-alpha therapy and patients with cirrhosis. In conclusion, alisporivir represents an attractive candidate component of future interferon-free regimens.\",\"The goal of treatment of chronic hepatitis C is to achieve a sustained virological response, which is defined as exhibiting undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels in serum following therapy for at least six months. However, the current treatment is only effective in 50% of patients infected with HCV genotype 1, the most prevalent genotype in Brazil. Inhibitors of the serine protease non-structural protein 3 (NS3) have therefore been developed to improve the responses of HCV-infected patients. However, the emergence of drug-resistant variants has been the major obstacle to therapeutic success. The goal of this study was to evaluate the presence of resistance mutations and genetic polymorphisms in the NS3 genomic region of HCV from 37 patients infected with HCV genotype 1 had not been treated with protease inhibitors. Plasma viral RNA was used to amplify and sequence the HCV NS3 gene. The results indicate that the catalytic triad is conserved. A large number of substitutions were observed in codons 153, 40 and 91; the resistant variants T54A, T54S, V55A, R155K and A156T were also detected. This study shows that resistance mutations and genetic polymorphisms are present in the NS3 region of HCV in patients who have not been treated with protease inhibitors, data that are important in determining the efficiency of this new class of drugs in Brazil.\",\"IDX184 is a liver-targeted nucleotide prodrug that selectively inhibits HCV NS5B polymerase.\",\"Autoantibodies were studied in a well-characterized cohort of children with chronic hepatitis C during treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin to assess the relation with treatment and development of autoimmune disease.\",\"A patient classified as HCV-1a-positive by both LiPA Siemens 2.0 and Abbott RealTime HCV Genotype II was instead found to be infected with HCV-1g, as determined by phylogenetic analysis of NS3 sequences. HCV-1g NS3 sequences available to date naturally harbour the resistance substitution T54S, plus P131S and L135F changes, located in the highly conserved NS3 positions within the boceprevir-binding site, as determined by structural modelling. HCV-1g NS3 sequences show some similarities to HCV-4 and are poorly responsive to interferon/ribavirin and to boceprevir/telaprevir; this patient was also a null-responder to boceprevir treatment. Baseline genotypic resistance testing may provide crucial information for the management of first-generation protease-inhibitor-based regimens, including both HCV genotype/subtype and natural resistance.\",\"About sixty thousand new cases of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are recorded in Brazil each year. These cases are currently treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) with an overall success rate of 50%. New compounds for anti-HCV therapy targeted to the HCV NS3 protease are being developed and some already form the components of licensed therapies. Mapping NS3 protease resistance mutations to protease inhibitors or anti-viral drug candidates is important to direct anti-HCV drug treatment.\",\"Resistance to direct-acting antivirals represents a new challenge in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.\",\"The addition of hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors (PIs) to interferon and ribavirin therapy has significantly improved the efficacy of treatment for HCV infection. However, for patients who do not respond to therapy, the selection of HCV variants with resistance to PIs is likely. Resistant variants, such as R155K and A156T/V, result in extensive cross-resistance to other HCV PIs. Despite the rapid and frequent appearance of PI-resistant HCV variants, the long-term clinical implications are unknown. In particular, progress in the development of other HCV antivirals, such as NS5A inhibitors, next-generation NS3 protease inhibitors, and NS5B nucleoside and nonnucleoside inhibitors, has provided a broad selection of potent antivirals such that interferon-free therapy is a reality. Promising results from early stages of interferon-free trials will be reviewed.\",\"Daclatasvir (DCV; BMS-790052) is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A replication complex inhibitor (RCI) with picomolar to low nanomolar potency and broad genotypic coverage in vitro. Viral RNA declines have been observed in the clinic for both alpha interferon-ribavirin (IFN-\\u03b1-RBV) and IFN-RBV-free regimens that include DCV. Follow-up specimens (up to 6 months) from selected subjects treated with DCV in 14-day monotherapy studies were analyzed for genotype and phenotype. Variants were detected by clonal sequencing in specimens from baseline and were readily detected by population sequencing following viral RNA breakthrough and posttreatment. The major amino acid substitutions generating resistance in vivo were at residues M28, Q30, L31, and Y93 for genotype 1a (GT-1a) and L31 and Y93 for GT-1b, similar to the resistance substitutions observed with the in vitro replicon system. The primary difference in the resistance patterns observed in vitro and in vivo was the increased complexity of linked variant combinations observed in clinical specimens. Changes in the percentage of individual variants were observed during follow-up; however, the overall percentage of variants in the total population persisted up to 6 months. Our results suggest that during the 14-day monotherapy, most wild-type virus was eradicated by DCV. After the end of DCV treatment, viral fitness, rather than DCV resistance, probably determines which viral variants emerge as dominant in populations.\",\"Soluble CD36 (sCD36) plasma levels, a known marker of cardiometabolic disorders, are associated with surrogate markers of steatosis, while experimental and human studies show a link between CD36 expression in the liver and steatosis. In a cohort of patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C (G1 CHC), we tested the association of sCD36 plasma levels with host and viral factors and sustained virological response (SVR). One hundred and seventy-five consecutive biopsy-proven patients were studied. sCD36 plasma levels were assessed by an in-house ELISA. All biopsies were scored by one pathologist for staging and grading (Scheuer) and graded for steatosis, which was considered moderate-severe if \\u226520%. Patients underwent standard of care therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. The severity of steatosis progressively increased according to sCD36 quartiles (P = 0.02); total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were significantly higher in patients in the lower quartile compared to all the others. Gamma-glutamyl transferase (P = 0.02), homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA) score (P = 0.002) and sCD36 (P = 0.04) were independently associated with the severity of steatosis as continuous variable. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that HOMA (OR 1.243, 95% CI 1.04-1.484, P = 0.01) and sCD36 (OR 1.445, 95%CI 1.135-1.839, P = 0.003) were independently linked to steatosis \\u226520%. No association was found between sCD36 and SVR. CD36 is linked to steatosis and insulin resistance in patients with G1 CHC, but does not predict response to treatment. The potential of sCD36 as a surrogate marker of steatosis should be further investigated.\",\"Mericitabine is a selective nucleoside analog inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, with activity across all HCV genotypes. Treatment-na\\u00efve patients infected with HCV genotype 1 or 4 were randomized to 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with either mericitabine 1,000 mg (N = 81) or placebo (N = 85) twice-daily (BID) in combination with pegylated interferon alpha-2a (Peg-IFN\\u03b1-2a)/ribavirin (RBV). Patients randomized to mericitabine with HCV RNA <15 IU/mL from week 4 to 22 (extended rapid virologic response; eRVR) stopped all treatment at week 24; all other patients continued Peg-IFN\\u03b1-2a/RBV to complete 48 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR; HCV RNA <15 IU/mL after 24 weeks of treatment-free follow-up). SVR was achieved in 56.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 45.9-67.0) of mericitabine-treated patients and 36.5% (95% CI: 27.0-47.1) of placebo-treated patients (\\u0394 = 20.3%; 95% CI 5.5-35.2). SVR rates were higher in mericitabine- than placebo-treated patients when subdivided by IL28B genotype (CC, 77.8% versus 56.0%; non-CC, 44.1% versus 16.2%) and hepatic fibrosis (noncirrhotic, 63.3% versus 41.9%; cirrhotic, 38.1% versus 21.7%). Overall relapse rates were 27.7% and 32.0% in mericitabine- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. No evidence of NS5B S282T-variant virus or phenotypic resistance to mericitabine was observed in the one patient who experienced partial response. No S282T variants were detected in any baseline samples. The safety profile of mericitabine was similar to that of, and fewer patients in the mericitabine than in the placebo group discontinued treatment for safety reasons.\",\"Rapid allograft infection complicates liver transplantation (LT) in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin therapy after LT has significant toxicity and limited efficacy. The effect of a human monoclonal antibody targeting the HCV E2 glycoprotein (MBL-HCV1) on viral clearance was examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study in patients infected with HCV genotype 1a undergoing LT. Subjects received 11 infusions of 50 mg/kg MBL-HCV1 (n=6) or placebo (n=5) intravenously with three infusions on day of transplant, a single infusion on days 1 through 7 and one infusion on day 14 after LT. MBL-HCV1 was well-tolerated and reduced viral load for a period ranging from 7 to 28 days. Median change in viral load (log10 IU/mL) from baseline was significantly greater (p=0.02) for the antibody-treated group (range -3.07 to -3.34) compared to placebo group (range -0.331 to -1.01) on days 3 through 6 posttransplant. MBL-HCV1 treatment significantly delayed median time to viral rebound compared to placebo treatment (18.7 days vs. 2.4 days, p<0.001). As with other HCV monotherapies, antibody-treated subjects had resistance-associated variants at the time of viral rebound. A combination study of MBL-HCV1 with a direct-acting antiviral is underway.\",\"Mericitabine is a nucleoside analog polymerase inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Treatment-na\\u00efve HCV genotype 1 or 4 patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with oral mericitabine at a dosage of 500 mg twice-daily (BID) for 12 weeks (A), 1,000 mg BID for 8 (B) or 12 weeks (C and D), or placebo BID for 12 weeks (E). All patients received pegylated interferon alpha-2a (Peg-IFN\\u03b1-2a; 40 kD)/ribavirin (RBV) at standard doses for 24 or 48 weeks during and after mericitabine/placebo therapy. Patients in arms A-C who maintained a virologic response (VR) (HCV RNA <15 IU/mL) from weeks 4 to 22 stopped all treatment at week 24; all other patients (arms A-E) continued Peg-IFN\\u03b1-2a/RBV to complete 48 weeks. The primary outcome was sustained VR (SVR) (HCV RNA <15 IU/mL after 24 weeks of untreated follow-up; SVR-24). VR rates were higher in arms A-D than in arm E at weeks 4 and 12 overall, in patients with and without cirrhosis and in patients with CC and non-CC IL28B genotypes. However, the overall SVR-24 rate in arms D (50.6%) and E (placebo, 51.2%) was similar and those in the response-guided therapy arms A, B, and C were lower (48.8%, 42.0%, and 32.9%, respectively). No viral breakthrough or mericitabine-resistance mutations (S282T) were observed during mericitabine therapy.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one of the most important causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and has a tremendous impact on public health worldwide. HCV is both hepatotropic and lymphotropic. Replication of HCV in diseased extrahepatic organs and tissues may either trigger latent autoimmunity or induce autoimmune disorders. In addition to established liver injury, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important feature of extrahepatic metabolic disorders which is attributed to HCV infection. It also has some impact on the disease activity, disease course, clinical outcomes, and treatment efficacy of antiviral therapy. Previous experimental and clinical findings have highly suggested that HCV per se is diabetogenic. The cause-effect interaction between a common endocrine disorder and an infectious disease is an important issue to elucidate. Although the precise mechanisms whereby HCV infection leads to insulin resistance (IR) and glucose abnormalities are not entirely clear, it differs from the usual pathogenesis of T2DM in those with non-HCV liver diseases. This review initially highlights epidemiological and pathophysiological studies addressing the mutual link between chronic HCV infection (CHC) and T2DM. The characteristics of glucose abnormalities in this special population are depicted from the current evidence. The mutual roles of IR and CHC with respect to the prediction of treatment efficacy, how treatment response affects IR, and the role of pancreatic beta cell function in the entire suite are discussed. With the rapid progression of antiviral therapy for CHC in the past decade, we have also listed some points of future perspective in this issue.\",\"A major challenge for antiviral treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is viral resistance, potentially resulting from the high variability of HCV envelope glycoproteins and subsequent selection of strains with enhanced infectivity and/or immune escape.\",\"Until recently, the standard-of-care therapy of patients with HCV infection involves treatment with interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). Host demographic and genetic factors as well as HCV genetic heterogeneity have been shown to be associated with outcomes of therapy. Although resistance to IFN/RBV remains an important clinical and public health problem, there are no reliable genetic markers for the prediction of the therapy outcomes. Recently, it was shown that adaptation to IFN, a major constituent of the host innate immunity, is reflected in the HCV genetic composition and epistatic connectivity among polymorphic genomic sites, thus providing novel genetic markers of IFN resistance. Consideration of coordinated evolution among HCV genomic sites allows for identification of these genetic markers from short regions of the HCV genome and for accurate prediction of therapeutic outcomes. HCV genomic co-evolution offers a general framework for the detection of predisposition to IFN resistance, and possibly to resistance to direct-acting antivirals.\",\"The current treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 chronic infection is the addition of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) with a protease inhibitor (telaprevir or boceprevir) to the pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) regimen. Major progress has been made in the past few years: numerous ongoing trials with different compounds, increasing sustained virological response (SVR) rates with oral regimens and shortened treatment duration. Combinations of antivirals with additive potency that lack cross-resistance and with a good safety profile may provide new regimens in the future to make HCV the first chronic viral infection to be eradicated worldwide with a finite duration of combination DAA therapy without IFN.\",\"Telaprevir and boceprevir are the first direct-acting antiviral agents approved for use in HCV treatment and represent a significant advance in HCV therapy. However, these first-generation drugs also have significant limitations related to thrice-daily dosing, clinically challenging side-effect profiles, low barriers to resistance and a lack of pan-genotype activity. A second wave of protease inhibitors are in phase II and III trials and promise to provide a drug regimen with a better dosing schedule and improved tolerance. These second-wave protease inhibitors will probably be approved in combination with PEG-IFN and Ribavirin (RBV), as well as future all-oral regimens. The true second-generation protease inhibitors are in earlier stages of development and efficacy data are anxiously awaited as they may provide pan-genotypic antiviral activity and a high genetic barrier to resistance.\",\"HCV is a worldwide disease with an estimated prevalence by WHO of 3%. Hepatitis C virus 4 is prevalent in Africa and the Middle East, especially Egypt. The treatment of HCV4 is affected by many factors, related to the virus itself (genotype, pretreatment viral load and prevalent quasispecies), to the host (genetic factors, age, ethnicity and liver histology), to the presence of comorbidities (obesity, insulin resistance and co-infections) and to the therapeutic drugs (type, dose and duration). Optimizing treatment is the goal of daily practice to obtain the best results for the patient.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis and end stage liver disease. More than 200million people are living with HCV worldwide with high morbidity and mortality. There is no vaccine available for this virus; the approved treatment option for the majority of HCV genotypes is the combination of pegylated (Peg) interferon and ribavirin. The therapy has a different response rate on different HCV genotypes and has a number of side effects. Recently, as well as Peg interferon and ribavirin, two protease inhibitors have been introduced to treat patients with HCV genotype 1 infection. The protease inhibitors have rapid onset of resistance and are not approved for use for infections with other HCV genotypes. The HCV NS5B gene encodes RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the key player in viral replication and is a promising target for the development of antiviral drugs. HCV NS5B has been studied in various biochemical assays, cell based assays and animal model systems. So far, a number of nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors have been screened for effects on viral replication. This review presents a deep insight into the structure and function of HCV polymerase and the effect of various nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors on viral replication.\",\"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the common sequelae of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. It remains controversial, however, whether HCV itself plays a direct role in the development of HCC. Although HCV core, NS3, and NS5A proteins were reported to display tumorigenic activities in cell culture and experimental animal systems, their clinical impact on HCC development in humans is still unclear. In this study we investigated sequence polymorphisms in the core protein, NS3, and NS5A of HCV genotype 1b (HCV-1b) in 49 patients who later developed HCC during a follow-up of an average of 6.5 years and in 100 patients who did not develop HCC after a 15-year follow-up. Sequence analysis revealed that Gln at position 70 of the core protein (core-Gln(70)), Tyr at position 1082 plus Gln at 1112 of NS3 (NS3-Tyr(1082) /Gln(1112)), and six or more mutations in the interferon/ribavirin resistance-determining region of NS5A (NS5A-IRRDR\\u22656) were significantly associated with development of HCC. Multivariate analysis identified core-Gln(70) , NS3-Tyr(1082) /Gln(1112) , and \\u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) levels (>20 ng/L) as independent factors associated with HCC. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a higher cumulative incidence of HCC for patients infected with HCV isolates with core-Gln(70) , NS3-Tyr(1082) /Gln(1112) or both than for those with non-(Gln(70) plus NS3-Tyr(1082) /Gln(1112)). In most cases, neither the residues at position 70 of the core protein nor positions 1082 and 1112 of the NS3 protein changed during the observation period.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects more than 2 % of the world population with highest prevalence in parts of Africa and Asia. Past standard of care using interferon \\u03b1 and ribavirin had adverse effects and showed modest efficacy for some HCV genotypes spurring the development of direct acting antivirals (DAAs). Such DAAs target viral proteins and are thus better tolerated but they suffer from emergence of vial resistance. Furthermore, DAAs are often HCV genotype specific. Novel drug candidates targeting host factors required for HCV propagation, so called host-targeting antivirals (HTAs), promise to overcome both caveats. The genetic barrier to resistance is usually considered to be high for HTAs and all HCV genotypes presumably use the same host factors. Recent data, however, challenge these assumptions, at least for some HTAs. Here, we highlight the most important host-targeting strategies against hepatitis C and critically discuss their opportunities and risks.\",\"Antiviral resistance among influenza A viruses is associated with high morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised hosts. However, treatment strategies for drug-resistant influenza A are not established. A triple-combination antiviral drug (TCAD) regimen consisting of amantadine (AMT), oseltamivir (OSL) and ribavirin (RBV) demonstrated good efficacy in an animal model.\",\"Increased \\u03b3-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity is associated with liver injury and with mortality in the general population. Less is known about its association with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) outcomes. We examined GGT as a predictor of both virological response to treatment and long-term clinical outcomes in the Hepatitis C Anti-viral Treatment Against Cirrhosis Trial (HALT-C). HALT-C enrolled patients with advanced liver disease (Ishak fibrosis score \\u22653) in two phases: a lead-in to establish lack of sustained viral response with full dose pegylated interferon (IFN) and ribavirin followed by a 3.5-year randomized trial with low-dose IFN. Low-dose IFN did not prevent liver disease progression, and patients were then followed for up to an additional 5 years off therapy. Analyses were performed for 1,319 patients who had GGT measured prior to initiation of treatment. Increases in risk with each increase in quintile of GGT (10-57, 58-89, 90-139, 140-230, 231-2,000 IU/L) were determined by logistic regression for treatment response or Cox regression for clinical outcomes. Baseline GGT was associated with male sex, nonwhite ethnicity, diabetes and insulin resistance, interleukin (IL)28B rs12979860 CT and TT genotypes, and numerous markers of liver disease injury and severity. In the lead-in phase, increasing GGT was strongly associated with diminished week 20 response, end of treatment response, and sustained virological response in both univariate and multivariate analyses controlling for factors known to be associated with treatment response (P < 0.0001). GGT was also associated with all clinical outcomes in univariate and multivariate analysis (P < 0.05) except for hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.46 in multivariate analysis).\",\"Cytokines play a key role in the regulation of immune responses. In hepatitis C virus infection, the production of abnormal cytokine levels appears to contribute in the progression of the disease, viral persistence, and affects response to therapy. Cytokine genes polymorphisms located within the coding/regulatory regions have been shown to affect the overall expression and secretion of cytokines. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association of of IL28B rs12979860, TGF-\\u03b21-509, TNF-\\u03b1 308, and IL-10-1082 polymorphisms with the susceptibility to hepatitis C virus genotype 4 infection and response to pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin therapy.\",\"Recent data suggest that vitamin A modulates the expression of type I interferon receptor enhancing the antireplication effect of interferon-\\u03b1 on hepatitis C virus (HCV). This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency among patients with chronic HCV infection and to assess whether vitamin A deficiency could be associated with unresponsiveness to interferon-based antiviral therapy. The analysis included 199 consecutive treatment-na\\u00efve chronic HCV patients in whom pretreatment serum vitamin A and 25-OH vitamin D were measured; 119 healthy blood donors were used as controls. Median (interquartile range) serum vitamin A in HCV-positive patients was significantly lower than in controls: 256 ng/mL (128-440) versus 742 (624-942, P<0.0001). Overall sustained viral response was achieved in 122/199 patients, 46/109 infected by difficult to treat HCV genotypes. In these latter, 39/104 (37.5%) were nonresponders. At multivariate analysis, nonresponse to antiviral therapy was predicted by carriage of interleukin (IL)-28B T/* genotypes, baseline serum levels of \\u03b3GT>60 IU/mL, of HCV RNA>600,000 IU/mL, of vitamin A\\u2264100 ng/mL, and a cumulative dose of ribavirin\\u226480%. Seventeen patients (9.0%) had both serum levels of vitamin A\\u2264100 ng/mL and of vitamin D\\u226420 ng/mL; the presence of a combined vitamin A and D deficiency was found to be a strong independent predictor of nonresponse to antiviral therapy.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease world-wide. Current interferon and ribavirin (IFN/RBV) therapy is effective in 50%-60% of patients. HCV exists in infected patients as a large viral population of intra-host variants (quasispecies), which may be differentially resistant to interferon treatment. We present a method for measuring differential interferon resistance of HCV quasispecies based on mathematical modeling and analysis of HCV population dynamics during the first hours of interferon therapy. The mathematical models showed that individual intra-host HCV variants have a wide range of resistance to IFN treatment in each patient. Analysis of differential IFN resistance among intra-host HCV variants allows for accurate prediction of response to IFN therapy. The models strongly suggest that resistance to interferon may vary broadly among closely related variants in infected hosts and therapy outcome may be defined by a single or a few variants irrespective of their frequency in the intra-host HCV population before treatment.\",\"Machine-learning methods in the form of Bayesian networks (BN), linear projection (LP) and self-organizing tree (SOT) models were used to explore association among polymorphic sites within the HVR1 and NS5a regions of the HCV genome, host demographic factors (ethnicity, gender and age) and response to the combined interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy. The BN models predicted therapy outcomes, gender and ethnicity with accuracy of 90%, 90% and 88.9%, respectively. The LP and SOT models strongly confirmed associations of the HVR1 and NS5A structures with response to therapy and demographic host factors identified by BN. The data indicate host specificity of HCV evolution and suggest the application of these models to predict outcomes of IFN/RBV therapy.\",\"Recurrent HCV disease is the most common cause of graft loss and patient mortality in HCV-infected liver transplant (LT) recipients. Risk factors for more severe recurrence that are potentially modifiable are older donor age, prolonged cold ischaemia time, prior treated acute rejection, CMV hepatitis, IL28B donor genotype, and post-LT insulin resistance. The most effective means of preventing HCV recurrence is eradicating HCV prior to LT. Select wait-list candidates with compensated or mildly decompensated disease can be considered for antiviral treatment with peginterferon, ribavirin (and protease inhibitor if genotype 1). For the majority of LT patients, HCV treatment must be delayed until post-transplant. Treatment is generally undertaken if histologic severity reaches grade 3 or 4 necroinflammation or stage \\u22652 fibrosis, or if cholestatic hepatitis. Achievement of sustained viral response (SVR) post-LT is associated with stabilization of fibrosis and improved graft survival. SVR is attained in ~30% of patients treated with peginterferon and ribavirin. Poor tolerability of therapy is a limitation. Combination therapy with telaprevir or boceprevir added to peginterferon and ribavirin is anticipated to increase efficacy but with higher rates of adverse effects and challenges in managing drug-drug interactions between the protease inhibitors and calcineurin inhibitors/sirolimus.\",\"The recent development of small molecule compounds that directly inhibit the viral life cycle represents a major milestone for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. These new drugs that are collectively termed direct-acting antivirals (DAA) include a range of inhibitors of the non-structural (NS) 3/4A protease, NS5B polymerase and NS5A protein. Two NS3/4A protease inhibitors (boceprevir and telaprevir) in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin have now been approved for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection and cure rates could be increased by 20-30%. However, the majority of DAAs is still in early clinical development. The rapid replication rate of HCV, along with the error-prone polymerase activity leads to a high genetic diversity among HCV virions that includes mutants with reduced susceptibility to DAA-therapy. These resistance-associated variants often occur at very low frequencies. However, during DAA-based treatment, rapid selection of resistance mutations may occur, eventually leading to viral break-through. A number of variants with different levels of resistance have been described in vitro and in vivo for virtually all DAAs. We review the parameters that determine DAA resistance as well as the clinical implications of resistance testing. In addition, the most recent literature and conference data on resistance profiles of DAAs in clinical development and future strategies to avoid the emergence of viral resistance are also discussed.\",\"Understanding of the natural history and treatment responsiveness of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has evolved rapidly in recent years. Advances in HCV molecular virology and host genetics can now better predict spontaneous clearance and treatment outcomes. HCV genotype is the most important viral factor predicting interferon-\\u03b1 treatment responsiveness; HCV-1 subtype is emerging as a key determinant of the efficacy of direct acting antiviral therapy. Genome-wide association studies have recently identified several clinically important host determinants of the outcomes of peginterferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin treatment outcome: IL28B polymorphism is associated with spontaneous clearance and treatment responsiveness; ITPA polymorphism protects against ribavirin-induced anaemia and dose reductions; genetic determinants of liver fibrosis progression rate have been proposed. In this review, we evaluate the role of viral and host genetics in the natural history and treatment outcomes of chronic HCV infection, and consider how this knowledge might help individualize clinical management in the era of DAA therapy.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C affects approximately 170 million people worldwide and is one of the leading causes of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Until 2011, the only therapeutic option was combination therapy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin, with efficacy rates around 50% and plenty of side effects. In the past months, important steps have been made towards a more effective antiviral therapy. However, we are still far from both highly efficient and well-tolerable ideal therapy. The development of new drugs against HCV is a very dynamic field. This review summarizes the up-to-date knowledge of the most significant anti-HCV compounds in development.\",\"The current epidemic of HCV infection affects almost 180 million people, of whom one quarter already has cirrhosis. The number with hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure are projected to treble over the next three decades. The only means of reducing this health burden is through increased eradication with antiviral therapy. However, current antiviral therapies are limited by poor efficacy and tolerability, especially in patients with HCV genotype 1. Pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) has significant side effects, must be administered for up to 48 weeks and cures about less than half of patients. Many patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C are unsuitable for or refuse to undertake such therapy. Although the recent approval of triple therapy with telaprevir or boceprevir with PEG-IFN/RBV has increased cure and reduced duration of therapy, this is still unsuitable for patients either intolerant of or with contraindications to IFN or RBV. In addition, triple therapy will have limited benefit in previous null responders to PEG-IFN/RBV, and in those with advanced fibrosis. Finally, few protease inhibitors have antiviral efficacy in patients infected with non-1 genotype HCV. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of an IFN-free, all-oral treatment regimen consisting of direct-acting antiviral drugs with different mechanisms of stopping the virus and a higher barrier to resistance, which can improve cure rates across all HCV genotypes. The likely successful regimen will contain at least two direct-acting antivirals with different targets of action, of which at least one will have a high barrier to resistance. The likely duration of IFN-free direct-acting antiviral therapy will be between 6 and 12 weeks depending on early-on-treatment virological responses.\",\"HCV infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and affects nearly 170 million people worldwide. Whereas the previous standard of care with pegylated interferon and ribavirin had a modest effectiveness, the recent approval of two highly potent protease inhibitors and the ongoing development of dozens of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) constitute a major milestone for HCV therapy. Mathematical modelling of viral kinetics under treatment has played an instrumental role in improving our understanding of virus pathogenesis and in guiding drug development. Here, we review the current state of HCV kinetic modelling, and challenges to the standard biphasic viral decline model that arise when fitting viral kinetic models to data obtained with DAAs.\",\"We assessed the safety and efficacy of boceprevir (BOC) plus peginterferon-ribavirin (PR) in patients with HCV-G1 infection and advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis (Metavir F3/F4).\",\"GS-9669 is a highly optimized thumb site II nonnucleoside inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA polymerase, with a binding affinity of 1.35 nM for the genotype (GT) 1b protein. It is a selective inhibitor of HCV RNA replication, with a mean 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of \\u2264 11 nM in genotype 1 and 5 replicon assays, but lacks useful activity against genotypes 2 to 4. The M423T mutation is readily generated clinically upon monotherapy with the thumb site II inhibitors filibuvir and lomibuvir, and it is notable that GS-9669 exhibited only a 3-fold loss in potency against this variant in the genotype 1b replicon. Rather than M423T, resistance predominantly tracks to residues R422K and L419M and residue I482L in GT 1b and 1a replicons, respectively. GS-9669 exhibited at least additive activity in combination with agents encompassing four other direct modes of action (NS3 protease, NS5A, NS5B via an alternative allosteric binding site, and NS5B nucleotide) as well as with alpha interferon or ribavirin in replicon assays. It exhibited high metabolic stability in in vitro human liver microsomal assays, which, in combination with its pharmacokinetic profiles in rat, dog, and two monkey species, is predictive of good human pharmacokinetics. GS-9669 is well suited for combination with other orally active, direct-acting antiviral agents in the treatment of genotype 1 chronic HCV infection. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT01431898.).\",\"NS5A protein plays a key role in hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. Daclatasvir (DCV, BMS-790052) is a first-in-class inhibitor of the HCV NS5A replication complex with potent antiviral activity but a low barrier to resistance. DCV as triple therapy in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin resulted in a high rate of early virologic response in treatment-na\\u00efve patients with genotype 1 infection; as quadruple therapy in combination with asunaprevir (BMS-650032, NS3 protease inhibitor), pegylated interferon, and ribavirin, it resulted in a high rate of sustained virologic response in genotype 1 prior null responders.\",\"Nucleoside/nucleotide analogue polymerase inhibitors (NPIs) are analogues of natural substrates that bind the active site of NS5B and terminate viral RNA chain generation and generally provide a high genetic barrier to resistance and are effective in all genotypes. NPIs such as sofosbuvir (GS-7977) show high antiviral activities that, together with their high genetic barrier to resistance, suggest that they are optimal backbone candidates for all-oral combination therapies. Several trials are ongoing to further define the potential of all-oral regimens with sofosbuvir (GS-7977). Recent interim analyses indicate that many patients treated with only 2 direct-acting antiviral agents experience viral breakthrough, which can be significantly reduced by the addition of ribavirin without pegylated interferon \\u03b1.\",\"Monotherapy is an ineffective way to treat hepatitis C and it leads to rapid development of resistance. An increasing number of drugs are currently being developed for the treatment of hepatitis C. This allows combination strategies that can overcome the development of resistance and improve sustained virologic response rates. This article focuses on the 2 main strategies in development: quadruple combination therapies, including pegylated-interferon and triple/quadruple pegylated-interferon free combination therapies. If the first combinations are leading to extremely high sustained virologic responses, the second ones offer hope that the era of pegylated-interferon will end soon.\",\"Antiviral treatment of chronic hepatitis C is not invariably successful, costly and associated with serious side-effects, and therefore should be indicated only when the chances of benefitting patients exceed the potential risks. The suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) family members have been suggested to affect the rate of virological response to therapy, but the published evidence is conflicting.\",\"Over the last decade, the standard of care for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C has been the combination of pegylated-interferon-alfa (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) which results in sustained virological response (SVR) rates of 75%-85% in patients with genotypes 2 or 3 but only of 40%-50% in patients with genotype 1. Currently, there are rapid and continuous developments of numerous new agents against hepatitis C virus (HCV), which are the focus of this review. Boceprevir and telaprevir, two first-generation NS3/4A HCV protease inhibitors, have been recently licensed in several countries around the world to be used in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV for the treatment of genotype 1 patients. Boceprevir or telaprevir based triple regimens, compared with the PEG-IFN/RBV combination, improve the SVR rates by 25%-31% in treatment-na\\u00efve genotype 1 patients, by 40%-64% in prior relapsers, by 33%-45% in prior partial responders and by 24%-28% in prior null responders. At the same time, the application of response-guided treatment algorithms according to the on-treatment virological response results in shortening of the total therapy duration to only 24 wk in 45%-55% of treatment-na\\u00efve patients. There are, however, several challenges with the use of the new triple combinations in genotype 1 patients, such as the need for immediate results of HCV RNA testing using sensitive quantitative assays, new and more frequent adverse events (anemia and dysgeusia for boceprevir; pruritus, rash and anemia for telaprevir), new drug interactions and increasing difficulties in compliance. Moreover, the SVR rates are still poor in very difficult to treat subgroups of genotype 1 patients, such as null responders with cirrhosis, while there is no benefit for patients who cannot tolerate PEG-IFN/RBV or who are infected with non-1 HCV genotype. Many newer anti-HCV agents of different classes and numerous combinations are currently under evaluation with encouraging results. Preliminary data suggest that the treatment of chronic HCV patients with well tolerated combinations of oral agents without PEG-IFN is feasible and may lead to a universal HCV cure over the next 5-10 years.\",\"Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. In addition to viral and environmental behavioral factors, host genetic diversity is believed to contribute to the spectrum of the disease. The sequencing of the human genome, together with the development of high-throughput technologies that measure the function of the genome, have afforded unique opportunities to develop profiles that can distinguish and classify discrete subsets of a disease and predict a response to therapy. In 2011, 2 directly acting antivirals (DAAs) have been approved for chronic HCV genotype 1 infection, Telaprevir and Boceprevir, and open a new area for HCV therapy. These 2 NS3/4 protease inhibitors are given in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Several DAAs are in development. Since a significant number of patients will fail to respond to treatment, or will have significant side effects, it is of major interest to predict a response to treatment as early as possible. Several studies are ongoing to identify biomarkers that could predict treatment outcome in patients with hepatitis C before treatment. Many of the genes upregulated in the liver between nonresponders and responders codes molecules secreted in the serum and can constitute a logical functional approach for the development of serum markers predictors of response to treatment. In the next future, further studies have several challenges to fight. First, large prospective cohorts with well phenotyped patients and appropriate tissue controls are needed. For response to treatment, the appropriate definition of sustained response and the same treatment regimen have to be addressed. Furthermore, improved technology and analytical procedures and the use of large numbers of patients for validation are needed.\",\"The response rate to treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus-genotype 1 and 4 infections was recently found to be strongly influenced by many polymorphisms. The aim of our study was to carry out an integrated analysis of the effects of polymorphisms and ribavirin (RBV) plasma exposure on outcome.\",\"Present interferon-based therapy for chronic hepatitis C is limited by both efficacy and tolerability. Telaprevir and boceprevir are the first two direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) that inhibit hepatitis C virus replication to be licensed for use in conjunction with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Numerous other DAAs are in clinical development, and phases 2 and 3 trials are evaluating interferon-free combination DAA therapy. Interferon-free sustained virologic responses have now been achieved with combinations of asunaprevir and daclatasvir; sofosbuvir and ribavirin; sofosbuvir and daclatasvir; faldaprevir and BI207127; ABT-450, ritonovir and ABT-333; ABT-450, ritonovir and ABT-072; miracitabine, danoprevir and ritonavir; and alisporivir and ribavirin. Some drugs are genotype-specific in their activity, whereas others are pan-genotypic, and differential responses for the genotype 1 subtypes 1a and 1b have emerged with many DAA combinations. Viral breakthrough and resistance are important considerations for future trial design. The prospect of interferon-free combination DAA therapy for hepatitis C virus is now finally becoming a reality.\",\"Insulin is critical for controlling energy functions including glucose and lipid metabolism. Insulin resistance seems to interact with hepatitis C promoting fibrosis progression and impairing sustained virological response to peginterferon and ribavirin. The main aim was to elucidate the direct effect of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection on insulin signaling both in vitro analyzing gene expression and protein abundance. Huh7.5 cells and JFH-1 viral particles were used for in vitro studies. Experiments were conducted by triplicate in control cells and infected cells. Genes and proteins involved in insulin signaling pathway were modified by HCV infection. Moreover, metformin treatment increased gene expression of PI3K, IRS1, MAP3K, AKT and PTEN more than >1.5 fold. PTP1B, encoding a tyrosin phosphatase, was found highly induced (>3 fold) in infected cells treated with metformin. However, PTP1B protein expression was reduced in metformin treated cells after JFH1 infection. Other proteins related to insulin pathway like Akt, PTEN and phosphorylated MTOR were also found down-regulated. Viral replication was inhibited in vitro by metformin. A strong effect of HCV infection on insulin pathway-related gene and protein expression was found in vitro. These results could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets in HCV infection and its co-morbidities.\",\"Insulin resistance has been strongly associated with the attainment of sustained viral response (SVR) in hepatitis C patients.\",\"To evaluate the association of insulin resistance (IR), viral load, and adipokine levels with liver histology in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC).\",\"Precore (PC) (G1896A) and basal core promoter (BCP) (A1762T/G1764A) mutations of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome often emerge in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Their roles in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion induced by interferon (IFN) therapy remain controversial, partly because quantitative analysis for these mutants is lacking. This study aimed to develop a new assay to accurately quantify the PC and BCP mutant percentages and correlate their dynamic changes with IFN-induced HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive CHB patients. The PC and BCP mutant percentages were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-pyrosequencing. Our results showed that this quantitative assay for PC and BCP mutants achieved high accuracy (R(2) > 0.99) within a range between 10% and 90% mutants. We examined dynamic changes of the PC and BCP mutant percentages following IFN treatment in 203 HBeAg-positive CHB patients. By multiple logistic regression analysis, we found that the chance of HBeAg seroconversion increased by 2.2% (odds ratio [OR] = 1.022, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.009-1.034, P = 0.001) and 2.3% (OR = 1.023, 95% CI: 1.010-1.037, P = 0.001) per 1% increase of the pretreatment PC and BCP mutant percentages, respectively, after adjustment for other predictors. However, only the pretreatment PC mutation percentage was significantly associated with HBeAg seroconversion with HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/mL (OR = 1.030, 95% CI: 1.014-1.047, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the mutant percentage of PC, but not BCP, in patients achieving HBeAg seroclearance with HBV DNA < 20,000 IU/mL increased significantly during IFN treatment (P = 0.039). Interestingly, patients with HBeAg seroconversion who had a high PC mutant percentage at the end of IFN treatment tended to exhibit high viremia after seroconversion.\",\"Combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin is the standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Treating CHC with SOC may show a sustained virological response (SVR) in approximately 50-70 % of genotype 1 CHC patients and an SVR in 70-90 % of genotype 2 CHC patients. The genotype, baseline viral load, and viral kinetics (i.e., rapid virologic response and early virologic response) can be used as predictors of response-guided therapy. Nonetheless, host factors, e.g. age, ethnicity, insulin resistance, and genetic variations, may also play important roles in the SVR in CHC patients treated with SOC. Recent genome-wide association studies have demonstrated that single-nucleotide polymorphisms near the interleukin 28B gene (IL28B) were associated with SVR to treatment with SOC in CHC patients. The IL28B polymorphisms may contribute to the viral kinetics during treatment. Asian people have favorable IL28B polymorphisms. This factor may at least partly explain the high eradication rate of hepatitis C by SOC in Asia. Combination therapy with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) and SOC can increase the SVR rates both in treatment-na\\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients. Although the IL28B polymorphisms also affect the SVR of triple therapy with SOC and first-generation protease inhibitors, pilot studies have demonstrated that potent DAAs might overcome the influence of IL28B polymorphisms. Thus, the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection could be simplified in the near future.\",\"The results from clinical trials testing new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C were the major focus of interest at the 2012 annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver. Besides triple combinations, in which any one of the new DAAs is given along with peginterferon-\\u03b1/ribavirin, clinical trials exploring interferon-free oral regimens combining several DAAs attracted major attention. The good tolerance, broad hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype activity, and high resistance barrier of sofosbuvir make this nucleotide analogue one of the most promising DAAs. Among HCV protease inhibitors, the safety, potency, and convenient dosing of simeprevir, asunaprevir, faldaprevir, and ABT-450/r were particularly highlighted. Among NS5A inhibitors, the good performance of daclatasvir encourages further clinical development. Finally, intriguing results were released about the role of interleukin 28B (IL-28B) polymorphisms using interferon-free regimens, indirectly supporting the role of innate immunity for clearing HCV definitively.\",\"The addition of boceprevir to therapy with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin results in significantly higher rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) in previously treated patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype-1 infection, compared with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin alone. We assessed SVR with boceprevir plus peginterferon alfa-2a-ribavirin (PEG2a/R) in patients with identical study entry criteria.\",\"We here report on the activity of 2'-C-methylcytidine (2CMC) [a nucleoside polymerase inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV)] on the in vitro replication of (murine) norovirus (MNV). 2CMC inhibits (i) virus-induced CPE formation, (ii) viral RNA synthesis and (iii) infectious progeny formation with EC(50) values of \\u223c2\\u03bcM. 2CMC acts at a time-point that coincides with the onset of viral RNA synthesis. Even following 30 passages of selective pressure no MNV-resistant virus was selected, which is in line with the high barrier to resistance of the nucleoside analogue for HCV. When combined with the broad-spectrum RNA virus inhibitor ribavirin, a marked antagonistic activity was observed indicating that these molecules should not be combined for the treatment of norovirus infections. Our results suggest that 2'-C-methyl nucleoside analogues should be further explored for the treatment and prophylaxis of norovirus infections.\",\"The standard therapeutic approach currently recommended for patients infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the triple therapy combining pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN), ribavirin (RBV)and NS3/NS4 protease inhibitors, boceprevir or telaprevir [1]. Protease inhibitors (PIs) are direct acting antiviral drugs (DAA) which, when added to PEG-IFN and RBV, are able to achieve a significant gain in terms of sustained virological response (SVR), both in na\\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients [2\\u20135]. The use of these new molecules, despite its in contestable benefits, reveals on the other hand new challenges: the emergence of variants with reduced sensitivity to PIs, the development of new or higher rate of side effects, drug to drug interactions, and significant increase in the overall cost of antiviral therapy. Among the two DAAs commonly used in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV (PEG-IFN/RBV) for the treatment of genotype 1 HCV patients, boceprevir has been licensed with a lead-in phase, while telaprevir has been licensed without. EMA approved regimens of both drugs are reported in Figs. 1 and 2. The lead-in phase represents an initial period of 4 weeks of dual therapy with PEG-IFN/RBV, in standard doses, followed by triple therapy. The concept of lead-in phase was initiated by the Schering\\u2013Plough company in order to improve efficacy of boceprevir-based triple therapy. Indeed, by lowering HCV RNA level, a short course of PEG-IFN/RBV may theoretically reduce the risk of viral breakthrough or resistance. However, there is still much controversy regarding the utility of the lead-in phase, some authors advocating its role in improving, and/or predicting triple therapy effectiveness, while others view it as a useless complication of the therapeutic regimen, its chief disadvantage being the inconvenience to the patient.\",\"Several host (age, sex, race, fibrosis stage, interleukin 28B polymorphism) and viral factors (hepatitis C virus [HCV] genotype, viral load) allow estimating the response to interferon-based therapies (which includes first-generation protease inhibitors) before treatment. However, treatment should not be denied to any patient based on unfavorable factors alone. Metabolic conditions associated with poor response (diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity) and alcohol abuse can be influenced before starting treatment. \\\"On-treatment\\\" predictors of response allow treatment to be tailored to the individual need of the patient. Patients with undetectable HCV RNA after 4 weeks (rapid virologic response [RVR]) have the highest chance for cure (>85%) both by dual and triple therapy. For triple therapy, the decision to shorten treatment requires that the virus remains undetectable for an additional 8 (telaprevir) to 20 (boceprevir) weeks (extended RVR). Based on viral kinetics, an even earlier prediction after 2 weeks of treatment with direct acting antivirals appears feasible.\",\"Influenza epidemics and pandemics are constant threats to human health. The application of antiviral drugs provides an immediate and direct control of influenza virus infection. At present, the major strategy for managing patients with influenza is through targeting conserved viral proteins critical for viral replication. Two classes of conventional antiviral drugs, the M2 ion channel blockers and the neuraminidase inhibitors, are frequently used. In recent years, increasing levels of resistance to both drug classes has become a major public health concern, highlighting the urgent need for the development of alternative treatments. Novel classes of antiviral compounds or biomolecules targeting viral replication mechanism are under development, using approaches including high-throughput small-molecule screening platforms and structure-based designs. In response to influenza virus infection, host cellular mechanisms are triggered to defend against the invaders. At the same time, viruses as obligate intracellular pathogens have evolved to exploit cellular responses in support of their efficient replication, including antagonizing the host type I interferon response as well as activation of specific cellular pathways at different stages of the replication cycle. Numerous studies have highlighted the possibility of targeting virus-host interactions and host cellular mechanisms to develop new treatment regimens. This review aims to give an overview of current and novel concepts targeting the virus and the host for managing influenza.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a modern-day pandemic; 2-3% of the world's population are thought to be infected with the virus and are subsequently at risk of developing end-stage liver diseases. The traditional standard of care (SOC) for HCV-infected patients has been limited to a regimen of pegylated-interferon alpha (pegIFN) and ribavirin; displaying low cure rates in a majority of patients and severe side effects. However, in 2011 the first direct-acting antivirals (DAA) were licensed to treat HCV-infected patients in combination with SOC, which served to elevate treatment response rates. The HCV drug development pipeline is currently populated with many additional and improved DAAs; primarily molecules that target the virus-encoded protease or polymerase enzymes. These molecules are being evaluated both in combination with the traditional SOC and together with other DAAs as all-oral pegIFN-free regimens with the ultimate goal of developing multiple DAA-containing HCV therapies that do not rely on an pegIFN backbone. A recent addition to the arsenal of HCV inhibitors in development is represented by an entirely new DAA class; molecules that target the HCV-encoded non-enzymatic NS5A protein. NS5A is essential for HCV propagation and, although its actual functions are largely unknown, it is likely a key regulator of viral genome replication and virion assembly. The protein is exquisitely sensitive to small molecule-mediated inhibition; NS5A-targeting molecules are probably the most potent antiviral molecules ever discovered and exhibit a number of other attractive drug-like properties, including activity against many HCV genotypes/subtypes and once-daily dosing potential. Although their mechanism of action is unclear, NS5A-targeting molecules are already proving their utility in clinical evaluation; particularly as components of pegIFN-sparring DAA combination regimens. This review will aim to amalgamate our current understanding and knowledge of NS5A-targeting molecules; their discovery, properties, applications, and insight into their future impact as components of all-oral pegIFN-free DAA combination therapies to combat HCV infection.\",\"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an economically significant animal disease because of the speed of its transmission. The current FMD vaccine provides no protection until 7days after the vaccination, which reduces its effectiveness in the case of an outbreak. Therefore, to find an alternative method of applying antiviral agents for rapid and enhanced inhibition of the FMD virus (FMDV), we compared the antiviral effects of promising antiviral agents and attempted to apply them in combination. First, we measured and compared the 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) to the mean inhibition effects of FMDV, and the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) to the mean cytotoxicity of antiviral agents such as ribavirin, guanidine-hydrochloride (guanidine-HCl), 6-azauridine, and recombinant adenovirus expressing three small interference RNAs (Ad-siRNA) or porcine interferon-\\u03b1 (Ad-porcine IFN-\\u03b1) in swine kidney cells (IBRS-2). The selectivity indices of ribavirin (35.2) and 6-azauridine (34.6) were higher than that of guanidine-HCl (26.9). The selectivity indices of Ad-siRNA or Ad-porcine IFN-\\u03b1 were 7\\u00d710(3) or 7\\u00d710(4) based on the adenoviral titer. Next, we tested the combined effects of the FMDV inhibition agents. Enhanced inhibition effects were observed in the IBRS-2 cells and in suckling mice from the combination of Ad-porcine IFN-\\u03b1 and Ad-siRNA or ribavirin. The combined application of these recombinant adenoviruses and ribavirin may enhance their inhibitory effect on FMDV and overcome FMDV resistance against antiviral agents.\",\"Recent reports show that R70Q and L/C91M amino acid substitutions in the core from different hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes have been associated with variable responses to interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy, as well to an increase of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk, liver steatosis and insulin resistance (IR). Mutations in NS5B have also been associated to IFN, RBV, nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors drug resistance. The prevalence of these mutations was studied in HCV RNA samples from chronically HCV-infected drug-na\\u00efve patients.\",\"Hepatitis C virus genotype 4 (HCV-4) is the cause of approximately 20% of the 180 million cases of chronic hepatitis C in the world. HCV-4 infection is common in the Middle East and Africa, with an extraordinarily high prevalence in Egypt. Viral genetic polymorphisms, especially within core and NS5A regions, have been implicated in influencing the response to pegylated-interferon and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) combination therapy in HCV-1 infection. However, this has not been confirmed in HCV-4 infection. Here, we investigated the impact of heterogeneity of NS5A and core proteins of HCV-4, mostly subtype HCV-4a, on the clinical outcomes of 43 Egyptian patients treated with PEG-IFN/RBV. Sliding window analysis over the carboxy terminus of NS5A protein identified the IFN/RBV resistance-determining region (IRRDR) as the most prominent region associated with sustained virological response (SVR). Indeed, 21 (84%) of 25 patients with SVR, but only 5 (28%) of 18 patients with non-SVR, were infected with HCV having IRRDR with 4 or more mutations (IRRDR \\u2265 4) (P = 0.0004). Multivariate analysis identified IRRDR \\u2265 4 as an independent SVR predictor. The positive predictive value of IRRDR \\u2265 4 for SVR was 81% (21/26; P = 0.002), while its negative predictive value for non-SVR was 76% (13/17; P = 0.02). On the other hand, there was no significant correlation between core protein polymorphisms, either at residue 70 or at residue 91, and treatment outcome. In conclusion, the present results demonstrate for the first time that IRRDR \\u2265 4, a viral genetic heterogeneity, would be a useful predictive marker for SVR in HCV-4 infection when treated with PEG-IFN/RBV.\",\"Cyclophilins (CyPs) are cellular proteins that are essential to hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. Since cyclosporine A was discovered to inhibit HCV infection, the CyP pathway contributing to HCV replication is a potential attractive stratagem for controlling HCV infection. Among them, CyPA is accepted to interact with HCV nonstructural protein (NS) 5A, although interaction of CyPB and NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), was proposed first.\",\"Telaprevir is a hepatitis C NS3/4A protease inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as part of combination therapy for the management of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection.\",\"Patients coinfected with HIV and HCV are at risk for developing portal hypertension (PHT), hyperdynamic circulation and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Data on the influence of antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 (PEG-IFN-\\u03b1) and ribavirin (RBV) are limited.\",\"Substitution of amino acid 70 and/or 91 in the core region of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b (HCV-1b) is an important predictor of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its impact on HCC in nonresponders to interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RIB) combination therapy is not clear.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is an important public health problem, and the standard treatment (combination of pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin) has an effectiveness rate of only 40%-50%. Novel virus-specific drugs have recently been designed, and multiple compounds are under development. The approval for the clinical use of direct-acting antivirals in 2011 (boceprevir [BOC] and telaprevir, viral NS3 protease inhibitors) has increased recovery rates by up to 70%. Therefore, a highly effective treatment has been envisioned for the first time. This paper focuses on BOC and the implementation of new BOC-based treatment regimes.\",\"For patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), mutations in the non-structural 5A (NS5A) gene are important predictive factors for the response to interferon (IFN) therapy. In the present study, factor analysis of the therapeutic response of patients following pegylated IFN and ribavirin combination therapy was assessed in a multicenter study. Chronic HCV-infected patients with genotype 1b and high viral load (n=96, mean age 56.5 years; 59 males, 68 females) treated with pegylated IFN-\\u03b1-2b and ribavirin combination therapy were enrolled. This study was conducted at Kobe University Hospital and 25 affiliated hospitals in Hyogo prefecture. Sixty-five patients (68%) completed treatment with both pegylated IFN and ribavirin at >80% of the weight-based scheduled dosages. Patients who reduced or terminated therapy were frequently aged women (mean age 60.8 years; 11 males, 17 females). Overall, a sustained viral response (SVR) was achieved in 42 (44%) patients out of 96. Based on per-protocol-based (PPB) analysis, the SVR rate in patients with \\u22656 amino acid (aa) mutations in the IFN resistance-determining region (IRRDR) (75%) or \\u22651 aa mutation in the IFN sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) (61%) was significantly higher than that in patients with <5 aa mutations in IRRDR (30%) or no mutation in ISDR (29%). Multivariate analysis revealed that rapid viral response (RVR) (odds ratio, 18.1) and mutations of \\u22656 in IRRDR (odds ratio, 15.5) were significantly associated with SVR. In conclusion, mutations in the NS5A region, particularly in patients with \\u22656 aa mutations in IRRDR were strongly associated with a therapeutic response to pegylated IFN and ribavirin combination therapy.\",\"The recent marketing authorizations and hence availability of the new protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, have profoundly changed the management of chronic hepatitis C patients. Guidelines for the use of these new drugs as part of a triple therapy, in combination with the standard therapy of peginterferon plus ribavirin, are proposed. The guidelines have been drawn up and evaluated by a meeting of the French Association for the Study of the Liver, posted online for comments, and extensively reviewed by international experts. The current published data on the various treatment strategies are reviewed. The guidelines address the majority of patient profiles including treatment-na\\u00efve patients and patients with failure of previous treatment. They recommend which patients should be treated with triple therapy and consider the results of triple therapy including the factors that are predictive of response. They consider the circumstances in which the length of triple therapy can be shortened and the advantages of a peginterferon plus ribavirin lead-in phase. Virological monitoring, stopping criteria, the evaluation of resistance to protease inhibitors, practical treatment management, treatment adherence and the management of side effects are discussed and simple guidelines proposed.\",\"In the TMC435-C101 study, 6 patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 were treated with the protease inhibitor TMC435 (200 mg once daily) as monotherapy for 5 days. Approximately 1.5 years later, 5 of these patients were re-treated with TMC435 (200 mg once daily) plus pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin (PegIFN\\u03b1-2a and RBV) for 4 weeks, followed by PegIFN\\u03b1-2a and RBV until week 48 (in the Optimal Protease inhibitor Enhancement of Response to therApy [OPERA-1] study). TMC435-resistant variants, which emerged in all 5 patients during the TMC435-C101 study, were no longer detected at the beginning of the OPERA-1 study based on virus population sequencing. During the OPERA-1 study, 3 patients had a sustained virologic response; deep sequencing indicated low-level persistence of resistant variants in the remaining 2 patients, which might have affected their response to re-treatment.\",\"GS-9451, a novel hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural 3/4a (NS3/4a) protease inhibitor, is highly active in patients infected with HCV genotype 1 (GT 1). The aim of this study is to characterize the clinical resistance profile of GS-9451 in GT 1 HCV-infected patients in a phase 1, 3-day monotherapy study. The full-length NS3/4A gene was population sequenced at baseline, on the final treatment day, and at follow-up time points. NS3 protease domains from patient isolates with emerging mutations were cloned into an NS3 shuttle vector, and their susceptibilities to GS-9451 and other HCV inhibitors were determined using a transient replication assay. No resistance mutations at NS3 position 155, 156, or 168 were detected in any of the baseline samples or in viruses from patients treated with 60 mg of GS-9451 once daily. Among patients who received 200 mg and 400 mg of GS-9451, viruses with mutations at position D168 (D168E/G/V) and R155 (R155K), which confer high-level resistance to GS-9451, were detected in those with GT 1b and GT 1a virus, respectively. Viruses with D168 mutations were no longer detected in any GT 1b patient at day 14 and subsequent time points. In GT 1a patients, R155K mutants were replaced by the wild type in 57% of patients at week 24. These NS3 clinical mutants were sensitive to NS5B and NS5A inhibitors, as well as alpha interferon (IFN-\\u03b1) and ribavirin. The lack of cross-resistance between GS-9451 and other classes of HCV inhibitors supports the utility of combination therapy.\",\"Telaprevir and boceprevir have received US Food and Drug Administration approval for use as triple therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Clinical trials of these agents included few African Americans, despite the overwhelming need for improved therapies in this racial group. Although African Americans are predicted to have improved response rates with this new treatment paradigm, clinical trials illustrate lower rates of sustained virologic response for this racial group versus whites. African Americans with genotype 1 HCV infection appear to require longer durations of therapy than do whites to achieve a sustained virologic response. Further investigation is required to adequately counsel African Americans with genotype 1 chronic HCV infection on the efficacy of telaprevir and boceprevir in their racial group. Increased participation of this racial group in HCV clinical trials is needed to improve therapies in this difficult-to-treat population.\",\"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is known to cause diseases of various severities. There is increasing interest to find drug combinations to treat HSV-1 by reducing drug resistance and cytotoxicity. Drug combinations offer potentially higher efficacy and lower individual drug dosage. In this paper, we report a new application of fractional factorial designs to investigate a biological system with HSV-1 and six antiviral drugs, namely, interferon alpha, interferon beta, interferon gamma, ribavirin, acyclovir, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. We show how the sequential use of two-level and three-level fractional factorial designs can screen for important drugs and drug interactions, as well as determine potential optimal drug dosages through the use of contour plots. Our initial experiment using a two-level fractional factorial design suggests that there is model inadequacy and that drug dosages should be reduced. A follow-up experiment using a blocked three-level fractional factorial design indicates that tumor necrosis factor alpha has little effect and that HSV-1 infection can be suppressed effectively by using the right combination of the other five antiviral drugs. These observations have practical implications in the understanding of antiviral drug mechanism that can result in better design of antiviral drug therapy.\",\"Hepatitis C (HCV), a leading cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, is the most common indication for liver transplantation in the United States. Although annual incidence of infection has declined since the 1980s, aging of the currently infected population is expected to result in an increase in HCV burden. HCV is prone to develop resistance to antiviral drugs, and despite considerable efforts to understand the virus for effective treatments, our knowledge remains incomplete. This paper reviews HCV resistance mechanisms, the traditional treatment with and the new standard of care for hepatitis C treatment. Although these new treatments remain PEG-IFN-\\u03b1- and ribavirin-based, they add one of the newly FDA approved direct antiviral agents, telaprevir or boceprevir. This new \\\"triple therapy\\\" has resulted in greater viral cure rates, although treatment failure remains a possibility. The future may belong to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues, non-nucleoside RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, or cyclophilin inhibitors, and the treatment of HCV may ultimately parallel that of HIV. However, research should focus not only on effective treatments, but also on the development of a HCV vaccine, as this may prove to be the most cost-effective method of eradicating this disease.\",\"Telaprevir, a hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitor has significantly improved sustained viral response rates when given in combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin, compared with current standard of care in hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infected patients. In patients with a failed sustained response, the emergence of drug-resistant variants during treatment has been reported. It is unclear to what extent these variants persist in untreated patients. The aim of this study was to assess using ultra-deep pyrosequencing, whether after 4 years follow-up, the frequency of resistant variants is increased compared to pre-treatment frequencies following 14 days of telaprevir treatment.\",\"The management of non-responders (NR) represents the most challenging of all aspects in the care of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of amantadine.\",\"Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300mg/kg/day bid for 5day starting at -2h gave 30% and 60% protection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments with zanamivir at 30 and 100mg/kg/day starting at -2h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Neither compound at <300mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24h. Amantadine was effective at 10, 30, and 100mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30mg/kg/day (highest dose tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60-100% for oral treatments initiated at -2h. For treatments begun at +24h, amantadine was protective at 30 and 100mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at 75mg/kg/day, with 60-100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300mg/kg/day starting at -2h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to evaluate compounds in combination.\",\"In the Phase 3 REALIZE study, 662 genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients with prior peginterferon/ribavirin treatment failure (including relapsers, partial, and null responders) were randomized to 12 weeks of telaprevir given immediately (T12/PR48) or following 4 weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin (lead-in T12/PR48), or 12 weeks of placebo (PR48), combined with a total of 48 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin. Sustained virologic response (SVR) rates were 64% (T12/PR48), 66% (lead-in T12/PR48), and 17% (PR48). This analysis aimed to characterize treatment outcomes and viral variants emerging in telaprevir-treated patients not achieving SVR. HCV NS3\\u00b74A population sequencing was performed at baseline, during treatment, and follow-up. Telaprevir-resistant variants were classified into lower-level (3- to 25-fold 50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50) ] increase: V36A/M, T54A/S, R155I/K/M/T, and A156S) and higher-level (>25-fold IC(50) increase: V36M+R155K and A156T/V) resistance. Resistant variants were uncommon at baseline. Overall, 18% (52%, 19%, and 1% of prior null and partial responders and relapsers, respectively) of telaprevir-treated patients had on-treatment virologic failure, with no significant difference with or without a lead-in. Virologic failure during the telaprevir-treatment phase was predominantly associated with higher-level resistance; virologic failure during the peginterferon/ribavirin-treatment phase was associated with higher- or lower-level, or wildtype variants, depending on genotype. Relapse occurred in 9% of patients completing assigned treatment and was generally associated with lower-level resistant variants or wildtype. Resistant variants were no longer detectable by study end (median follow-up of 11 months) in 58% of non-SVR patients.\",\"HCV subtype 1a has emerged as a predictor of poor response to triple hepatitis C therapy including boceprevir or telaprevir, which largely has been attributed to a lower resistance barrier in HCV-1a compared to -1b.\",\"The rate of non-response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (peg-IFN+RBV) in HCV/HIV coinfected patients is higher than in HCV-monoinfected patients. In this sense, the contribution of HCV genetic variability is unknown. The 5' untranslated (5'UTR), the nonstructural 5A (NS5A) and the second envelope (E2) HCV genomic regions have been implicated to peg-IFN therapy response. The proteins appear to block interferon (IFN)-induced RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and the 5'UTR may influence the viral lymphotropism.\",\"Approximately 50% of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) have a sustained virologic response to treatment with pegylated interferon (pegIFN)-\\u03b1 and ribavirin. Nonresponse to treatment is associated with constitutively increased expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the liver. Treatment of patients with acute hepatitis C (AHC) is more effective, with sustained virologic response rates greater than 90%. We investigated mechanisms of the different responses of patients with CHC and AHC to pegIFN-\\u03b1 therapy.\",\"Some regions associated with sensitivity to interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin have been identified in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome, including amino acid 70 in the core region (core a.a. 70), a.a. 2209-2248 (interferon sensitivity-determining region, ISDR) and a.a. 2334-2379 (interferon and ribavirin resistance-determining region, IRRDR).\",\"For the past decade, the standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C infection has been pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin. With US Food and Drug Administration approval of boceprevir and telaprevir--two protease inhibitors--the standard-of-care treatment for genotype-1 infection, the main genotype worldwide, is now peginterferon plus ribavirin and a protease inhibitor. Rates of sustained virological response or cure with triple combination treatment have improved substantially, both in patients who have had previous treatment and in those who have not. Improvements have been most substantial in populations regarded as difficult to treat, such as individuals with cirrhosis. However, despite improved response rates, protease inhibitors have incremental toxic effects, high costs, increased pill burden, and many drug interactions. Moreover, because new antiviral drugs directly inhibit hepatitis C virus, viral resistance has become an important issue, essentially precluding use of protease inhibitor monotherapy, and potentially restricting future treatment options for patients who consequently do not achieve sustained virological response. Protease inhibitors are the first of many antiviral medications that will probably be combined in future interferon-free regimens.\",\"We report a population pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) model of orally administered ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection enrolled in a multicenter clinical trial, including the estimation of covariate effects on ribavirin PK parameters and sustained viral response (SVR). Ribavirin concentrations obtained from 144 patients, consisting of n = 71 African American (AA) and n = 73 Caucasian Americans (CA), during 24 weeks of therapy were best described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination parameterized in terms of apparent oral clearance (CL/F), apparent central volume (Vc/F), apparent peripheral volume (Vp/F), and apparent intercompartmental clearance (Q/F). The typical population parameters were CL/F (19.0 L/h), Vc/F (1,130 L), Vp/F (4,020 L), and Q/F (38.6). The Vp/F was approximately 50% greater in AA compared to CA. Significant covariates in the SVR model included IL-28B genotype, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and ribavirin exposure during the first week (AUC(0-7)). The population PK and logistic regression models both described the observed ribavirin concentration data and SVR data well. These findings suggest that optimization of ribavirin plasma concentrations during the first week of ribavirin dosing is most critical in AA patients in order to increase the rate of SVR, especially those with the IL-28B TT genotype.\",\"Insulin resistance, fibrosis and steatosis are established predictors of response to peg-interferon/ribavirin therapy in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Several host genetic polymorphisms (IL28B, PNPLA3) modify treatment-outcome, the degree of steatosis or fibrosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of these polymorphisms on insulin resistance (IR) in treatment-na\\u00efve patients with chronic hepatitis C.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with insulin resistance (IR), which is a condition known to influence the progression of liver fibrosis and the response to pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin (RBV) therapy. We aimed to assess whether a sustained virological response (SVR) after antiviral therapy prevents the development of IR in the long term. Members of the Milan Safety Tolerability study cohort, who received PEG-IFN\\u03b12a/RBV or PEG-IFN\\u03b12b/RBV, underwent a homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) at the baseline and 24 months after treatment completion. For all patients (n = 431), a liver biopsy sample was scored for grading, staging (Ishak), and steatosis. At the baseline, IR (HOMA value > 2) was detected in 48 patients (12%), and it was associated with body weight (P = 0.03), an HCV load < 0.6 \\u00d7 10(6) IU/L (P = 0.006), fibrosis staging \\u2265 4 (P = 0.01), and moderate to severe steatosis (P = 0.03). IR did not influence the rates of end-of-treatment response (75% versus 69%, P = 0.4), SVR (63% versus 60%, P = 0.8), or relapse (19% versus 24%, P = 0.5). After treatment, IR developed in 49 of the 384 nondiabetic patients (14%). Although the mean baseline and posttreatment HOMA values were similar in SVR patients (1.11 \\u00b1 0.8 versus 1.18 \\u00b1 1.1, P = 0.25), patients experiencing treatment failure showed a significant increase in the mean HOMA value at the follow-up visit (1.20 \\u00b1 0.85 versus 1.49 \\u00b1 1.3, P = 0.007), and there was an increased rate of de novo IR in non-SVR patients versus SVR patients (17% versus 7%, P = 0.007). According to a logistic regression analysis, treatment failure (odds ratio = 2.81, 95% confidence interval = 1.39-5.67, P = 0.004) and a 10% body mass index increase (odds ratio = 6.42, 95% confidence interval = 1.69-24.3, P = 0.006) were significantly associated with the development of de novo IR.\",\"In comparison with peginterferon/ribavirin alone, boceprevir with peginterferon/ribavirin significantly improves sustained virological response (SVR) rates in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infections, but treatment failure remains a significant problem. Using phase 3 trial databases, we sought to develop stopping rules for patients destined to fail boceprevir-based combination therapy in order to minimize drug toxicity, resistance, and costs in the face of ultimate futility. Exploratory post hoc analyses using data from the Serine Protease Inhibitor Therapy 2 (SPRINT-2) study (treatment-naive patients) and the Retreatment With HCV Serine Protease Inhibitor Boceprevir and Pegintron/Rebetol 2 (RESPOND-2) study (treatment-experienced patients) were undertaken to determine whether protocol-specified stopping rules (detectable HCV RNA at week 24 for SPRINT-2 and at week 12 for RESPOND-2) could be refined and harmonized. In SPRINT-2, a week 12 rule with an HCV RNA cutoff of \\u2265 100 IU/mL would have discontinued therapy in 65 of 195 failures (sensitivity = 33%) without sacrificing a single SVR among 475 successes (specificity = 100%). Viral variants emerged after week 12 in 36 of the 49 evaluable patients (73%) who would have discontinued at week 12 using a \\u2265 100 IU/mL stopping rule. In RESPOND-2, five of six patients with week 12 HCV RNA levels between the lower limit of detection (9.3 IU/mL) and the lower limit of quantification (25 IU/mL) who continued therapy despite the protocol-stipulated futility rule achieved SVR; one additional patient with a week 12 HCV RNA level of 148 IU/mL also continued therapy, had undetectable HCV RNA at week 16, and attained SVR.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus infection affects more than 170 million people globally. The aim of treatment of CHC is to effect sustained elimination of the virus (a sustained virological response, SVR). Prior to the development of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents, the standard of care (SOC) for CHC comprised combined treatment with pegylated interferon (PegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV).\",\"HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors are proven therapeutic agents against chronic hepatitis C virus infection, with boceprevir and telaprevir having recently received regulatory approval as add-on therapy to pegylated interferon/ribavirin for patients harboring genotype 1 infections. Overcoming antiviral resistance, broad genotype coverage, and a convenient dosing regimen are important attributes for future agents to be used in combinations without interferon. In this communication, we report the preclinical profile of MK-5172, a novel P2-P4 quinoxaline macrocyclic NS3/4a protease inhibitor currently in clinical development. The compound demonstrates subnanomolar activity against a broad enzyme panel encompassing major hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes as well as variants resistant to earlier protease inhibitors. In replicon selections, MK-5172 exerted high selective pressure, which yielded few resistant colonies. In both rat and dog, MK-5172 demonstrates good plasma and liver exposures, with 24-h liver levels suggestive of once-daily dosing. When administered to HCV-infected chimpanzees harboring chronic gt1a or gt1b infections, MK-5172 suppressed viral load between 4 to 5 logs at a dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight twice daily (b.i.d.) for 7 days. Based on its preclinical profile, MK-5172 is anticipated to be broadly active against multiple HCV genotypes and clinically important resistance variants and highly suited for incorporation into newer all-oral regimens.\",\"Recent studies have suggested that insulin resistance exerts a strong influence on chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We analyzed pretreatment factors useful for predicting sustained virological response (SVR), especially interleukin (IL) 28B polymorphism and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).\",\"In hepatitis C infection, the production of inappropriate cytokines levels may contribute to viral persistence and may affect the response to antiviral therapy. We investigate the effect of IL4 C-590T and C-33T polymorphisms on the response to combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin in chronic HCV patients. These single nucleotide polymorphisms were determined by PCR-RFLP in 235 responder and 210 non-responder to combination therapy. The IL4-590 T/T and -33 T/T genotypes were associated with resistance to the therapy (p<0.001, p=0.001 respectively). Haplotypes T(-590) T(-33) and T(-590) C(-33) were associated with a higher risk in non-responder patients than the responders (p<0.001 for each) while frequency of haplotype C(-590) C(-33) (with all wild alleles) was significantly higher in responders as compared to non-responders (p<0.001). These results suggest that inheritance of the IL4 polymorphisms may be associated with resistance to combined antiviral therapy in Egyptian HCV patients.\",\"Patients who do not achieve sustained virological response to telaprevir/peginterferon (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin need to be identified. Predictive factors of virological response to the triple therapy in non-responders to previous PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy are not clear. The aims of this study were to determine the predictive factors of virological response to a 24-week regimen of triple therapy in 15 non-responders to previous PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy among 61 Japanese adults infected with HCV genotype 1. Overall, sustained virological response and end-of-treatment response were achieved by 27% and 60%, respectively. Telaprevir-resistant variants (by direct sequencing) appeared during or after treatment in 82% of patients who did not show sustained virological response, but disappeared at the end of study, except for one patient with resistant variant at baseline. Substitution at aa 70 (Arg70) and type of previous response to PEG-IFN/ribavirin (partial response) were identified as significant determinants of sustained virological response. In addition, alpha-fetoprotein level (<10 \\u00b5g/L) and type of previous response (partial response) were identified as significant determinants of end-of-treatment response. Prediction of response to therapy based on the combination of these factors had high sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values. In conclusion, this study identified amino acid substitution of the core region, alpha-fetoprotein level, and type of previous response as predictors of virological response to telaprevir/PEG-IFN/ribavirin in patients infected with HCV genotype 1b who had not responded to previous PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy.\",\"To comprehensively characterize the contribution of virological factors as well as interleukin-28B (IL28B) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in determining treatment responses in pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin (Peg-IFN/RBV) therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)-1b infection, we undertook a retrospective cohort analysis for the pretreatment dominant complete HCV open reading frame (ORF) amino-acid (aa) sequence study in 103 consecutive HCV-1b Japanese patients. The dominant HCV sequences classified by the response were subjected to systematic sliding-window comparison analysis to characterize response-specific viral sequences, along with IL28B SNP analyses (rs8099917). In each comparison of the patients between with and without rapid viral response (RVR), nonearly viral response (nEVR), sustained virological response (SVR), or relapse, the following regions were extracted as most significantly associated with the different responses respectively: nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) aa.2224-2248 (P = 1.2E-07); core aa.70 (P = 4E-04); NS5A aa.2340-2382 (P = 7.0E-08); and NS5A aa.2360-2377 (P = 1.1E-05). Those NS5A regions nearly coincided with the interferon (IFN) sensitivity-determining region (NS5A aa.2209-2248) and the IFN/RBV resistance-determining region (NS5A aa.2339-2379). In a multivariate analysis, the IL28B SNP (odds ratio [OR] = 16.8; P = 0.009) and NS5A aa.2340-2382 (OR = 13.8; P = 0.0003) were extracted as the two most-significant independent variables contributing to the final outcome.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with hepatitis C related cirrhosis being the most common indication for transplant and a major cause for the increase in hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Treatment for hepatitis C has consisted of nonspecific immunomodulatory therapies that stimulate the immune system and inhibit hepatitis C replication. Pegylated (peg-)interferon and ribavirin have been the standard of care with an overall sustained response rate of 40-50% in patients with genotype 1 infection, and 80% in genotype 2 or 3. Recently, direct-acting antiviral agents, including boceprevir, have demonstrated improved sustained response rates in patients with genotype 1 infection when given in combination with interferon and ribavirin. Boceprevir is a structurally novel hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural 3 (NS3) protease inhibitor that has demonstrated robust antiviral activity in HCV replicons. Clinically, in phase II and III trials, boceprevir 800 mg three times daily with peginterferon and ribavirin has led to improved sustained response rates in genotype 1 infection treatment-naive patients, relapsers, partial responders, and null responders. Phase II data have demonstrated that ribavirin is essential for optimal boceprevir response. Moreover, phase II data have suggested that a 4-week peginterferon or ribavirin lead-in strategy may reduce relapse rates and provide crucial on-treatment data for treatment response with boceprevir addition. Side effects of boceprevir when added to peginterferon and ribavirin are similar to peginterferon and ribavirin, though higher rates of anemia have been noted, with an incremental increase in erythropoietin use. The addition of boceprevir represents a major advance in patients with genotype 1 infection who are treatment na\\u00efve.\",\"Molecular biology techniques are routinely used to diagnose and monitor treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. These tools can detect and quantify viral genomes and analyze their sequence to determine their genotype or subtype and to identify nucleotide or amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to antiviral drugs. They include real-time target amplification methods, which have been standardized and are widely used in clinical practice to diagnose and monitor HBV and HCV infections, and next-generation sequencing techniques, which are still restricted to research laboratories. In addition, new enzyme immunoassays can quantify hepatitis B surface and hepatitis C core antigens, and point-of-care tests and alternatives to biologic tests that require whole-blood samples obtained by venipuncture have been developed. We review these new virologic methods and their clinical and research applications to HBV and HCV infections.\",\"Until recently, the standard of care (SOC) for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has consisted of a combination of pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 [corrected] plus ribavirin, administered for 24- to 48-weeks depending on the HCV genotype. The sustained virologic response rate for this SOC has been only about 50% in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV, the most prevalent genotype in Europe and North America. HCV therapy has been revolutionised recently by the approval of two direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) against the NS3/4A serine protease for use in genotype 1 HCV, the ketoamide inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir. The novel SOC marks the beginning of an extraordinary new era in HCV therapy. We review this new SOC with an emphasis on practical issues related to protease inhibitors, e.g. prescribing guidelines, futility rules and management of adverse events. We also give a perspective on what to expect in the coming years. Newer DAA with simplified dosing regimens and/or minimal toxicity which, when used in combination, will lead to viral eradication in most if not all CHC patients who undergo treatment. The novel agents in clinical development are paving the way for future interferon-sparing regimens.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes chronic infection in almost 2% of the world's population. If untreated, chronic carriers can develop severe liver disease including fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Until recently, hepatitis C was treated with a combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin, a treatment which was only partially effective and was plagued with side effects. In 2011 two inhibitors of the virally encoded NS3/4 protease have become part of standard therapy, which have improved treatment rates but can exacerbate the problematic side effects. While the addition of these first directly acting antivirals (DAAs) marks a milestone in anti-HCV therapy, new and improved combinations of drugs are desperately needed. New generations of drugs will have to address genetic variability of HCV and issues of viral resistance. Furthermore, combination therapies have to be tailored to effectively cure patient populations that have traditionally been hardest to treat, including patients with cirrhosis, those receiving liver transplants and individuals who are co-infected with HIV or hepatitis B virus. Since the discovery of HCV a plethora of experimental tools have been developed which enabled detailed analysis of various aspects of the viral life cycle and the interaction of HCV with its human host. Such studies have revealed a growing list of targets for therapeutic intervention, some of which will be discussed in this review.\",\"In patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection, telaprevir (TVR) in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin (PR) significantly increased sustained virologic response (SVR) rates compared with PR alone. However, genotypic changes could be observed in TVR-treated patients who did not achieve an SVR.\",\"The aim of this study is to review clinical trial data on the newly approved protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir to develop consensus recommendations on the optimal use of these agents for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. An expert panel of seven leading authorities in viral hepatitis was convened to establish and disseminate a practical guide on best practices for incorporating boceprevir and telaprevir into therapy for HCV infection in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients. The topics covered include selecting candidates for boceprevir- or telaprevir-based treatments, predictors of response and early viral kinetics, response-guided therapy approaches, on-treatment management strategies to optimize the likelihood of response and minimize the risk of drug resistance, management of adverse effects during therapy and key considerations for special populations. The expert panel incorporated the best available clinical evidence into recommendations on how boceprevir and telaprevir should be used in the clinical setting. They indicated how treatment regimens may differ according to the baseline factors, such as presence of cirrhosis and when therapy may need to be modified or stopped altogether because of adverse events or poor virologic response. This practical guide will serve as a valuable resource for clinicians embarking on the new treatment paradigm of boceprevir or telaprevir in combination with peginterferon/ribavirin for chronic genotype 1 HCV infection.\",\"Genotype 1 (G1) chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients achieving a rapid virological response (RVR) on pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin have a high chance of sustained virological response (SVR), influenced by IL28B status, viral load, fibrosis and insulin resistance. We assessed whether 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) serum levels are linked to RVR and can be used together with IL28B to construct a pretreatment model to predict RVR.\",\"HCV genotypes 2- or 3-infected patients with a rapid virological response (RVR) to therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirins who have a low viral load, noncirrhotic and nonobese may be considered for a shorter course of treatment. However, no studies have assessed host-viral factors associated with relapse in genotype 2 and 3 separately. Accordingly, we assessed whether 12 weeks of pegylated interferon and ribavirin was an optimized regimen for treatment of HCV genotype 2 and 3 with positive predictors of response. Power and sample size were a priori calculated and 96 consecutive chronic hepatitis C patients (53, genotype 2 and 43, genotype 3) without cirrhosis who were not obese and who achieved a RVR to therapy with peg-IFN-\\u03b1-2a and ribavirin were enrolled. Fibrosis, steatosis, homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance and HCV RNA were predefined variables to be evaluated in relapse. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. SVR rates were 98% and 84% for genotype 2 and 3, respectively. Analysis of genotype 3 patients who had relapse showed a negative correlation with steatosis (P < 0.0001) and HCV RNA (P < 0.015). Multivariate analysis showed that steatosis was the independent predictor of relapse (OR, 0.988; 95% CI, 0.981-0.993; P < 0.001). Genotype 3 patients with steatosis had a relapse rate of 36.4% and 15.8% in those with high and low viral load, respectively, whereas there was no relapse in those without steatosis. In conclusion, a 12-week course of therapy is sufficient for patients without cirrhosis, not obese and infected with HCV genotype 2 achieve a RVR. This is not the case for genotype 3. Steatosis is the independent predictor of relapse. New therapeutic strategies are necessary for this subgroup of HCV genotype 3.\",\"Insulin resistance is a risk factor for non-response to interferon/ribavirin therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The aim of this study was to determine the role played by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in the absence of interferon-\\u03b1 (IFN\\u03b1) response associated with insulin resistance. We induced insulin resistance by silencing IRS-2 or by treating HepG2 cells with tumor necrosis factor-\\u03b1 (TNF\\u03b1) and analyzed insulin response by evaluating Akt phosphorylation and IFN\\u03b1 response by measuring Stat-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthase and myxovirus resistance gene expression. The response to IFN\\u03b1 was also measured in insulin-resistant obese mice (high fat diet and ob/ob mice) untreated and treated with metformin. Silencing IRS-2 mRNA induces insulin resistance and inhibits IFN\\u03b1 response. Likewise, TNF\\u03b1 suppresses insulin and IFN\\u03b1 response. Treatment of cells with pervanadate and knocking down PTP-1B restores insulin and IFN\\u03b1 response. Both silencing IRS-2 and TNF\\u03b1 treatment increase PTP and PTP-1B activity. Metformin inhibits PTP and improves IFN\\u03b1 response in insulin-resistant cells. Insulin-resistant ob/ob mice have increased PTP-1B gene expression and activity in the liver and do not respond to IFN\\u03b1 administration. Treatment with metformin improves this response. In HepG2 cells, insulin resistance provokes IFN\\u03b1 resistance, which is associated with an increased PTP-1B activity in the liver. Inhibition of PTP-1B activity with pervanadate and metformin or knocking down PTP-1B reestablishes IFN\\u03b1 response. Likewise, metformin decreases PTP-1B activity and improves response to IFN\\u03b1 in insulin-resistant obese mice. The use of PTP-1B inhibitors may improve the response to IFN\\u03b1/ribavirin therapy.\",\"Development of more effective hepatitis C (HCV) antivirals has been rapid. The addition of orally administered medications that target the virus (direct acting antivirals [DAA]) to pegylated interferon and ribavirin have dramatically increased sustained virologic response rates in genotype 1-infected patients. However, the side effect profile remains challenging and the dosing schedule complicated. The DAAs currently in development possess the promise of once- or twice-daily dosing schedules, improved tolerance profiles, higher resistance barriers, and pan-genotypic antiviral activity. Emerging interferon-sparing, combination DAA data demonstrates that an interferon is not essential to achieve sustained virological response. This will expand the proportion of HCV-infected patients who can be considered for therapy and will allow for better-tolerated regimens. Expertise in HCV antiviral resistance, drug metabolism, and drug-drug interactions and optimization of drug adherence are now key requirements in the DAA era.\",\"The purpose of this report is to illustrate the US Food and Drug Administration's rationale for approving response-guided therapy (RGT) for telaprevir (TVR) in combination with pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin (P/R) for the treatment of adults with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C who were prior relapsers. RGT was prospectively evaluated in two registration trials of treatment-na\\u00efve subjects. In these studies, RGT allowed subjects who achieved undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA from weeks 4 and 12, known as extended rapid virologic response (eRVR), to stop all treatments at 24 weeks. A patient without eRVR received an additional 36 weeks of P/R after 12 weeks of a TVR triple regimen (total of 48 weeks). However, RGT in prior P/R relapsers was not prospectively evaluated. Empirical cross-trial data indicated high sustained virologic response rates (>90%) in prior relapsers achieving eRVR, irrespective of P/R duration (24 or 48 weeks). Further analyses demonstrated that interferon responsiveness does not change in P/R-experienced subjects with a second round of P/R. The comparability in interferon responsiveness across treatment courses allowed us to bridge data between treatment-na\\u00efve and P/R-experienced subjects to support the approval of RGT in prior relapse subjects.\",\"Because the current interferon (IFN)-based treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has a therapeutic limitation and side effects, a more efficient therapeutic strategy is desired. Recent studies show that supplementation of vitamin D significantly improves sustained viral response via IFN-based therapy. However, mechanisms and an active molecular form of vitamin D for its anti-HCV effects have not been fully clarified. To address these questions, we infected HuH-7 cells with cell culture-generated HCV in the presence or absence of vitamin D(3) or its metabolites. To our surprise, 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) [25(OH)D(3) ], but not vitamin D(3) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) , reduced the extra- and intracellular levels of HCV core antigen in a concentration-dependent manner. Single-cycle virus production assay with a CD81-negative cell line reveals that the inhibitory effect of 25(OH)D(3) is at the level of infectious virus assembly but not entry or replication. Long-term 25(OH)D(3) treatment generates a HCV mutant with acquired resistance to 25(OH)D(3) , and this mutation resulting in a N1279Y substitution in the nonstructural region 3 helicase domain is responsible for the resistance.\",\"Insulin resistance (IR) affects sustained virological response (SVR) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of adding metformin to peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin on the efficacy in patients with genotype 1 CHC and IR.\",\"Vaniprevir (MK-7009) is a macrocyclic hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 3/4A protease inhibitor. The aim of the present phase II study was to examine virologic response rates with vaniprevir in combination with pegylated interferon alpha-2a (Peg-IFN-\\u03b1-2a) plus ribavirin (RBV). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study, treatment-na\\u00efve patients with HCV genotype 1 infection (n = 94) were randomized to receive open-label Peg-IFN-\\u03b1-2a (180 \\u03bcg/week) and RBV (1,000-1,200 mg/day) in combination with blinded placebo or vaniprevir (300 mg twice-daily [BID], 600 mg BID, 600 mg once-daily [QD], or 800 mg QD) for 28 days, then open-label Peg-IFN-\\u03b1-2a and RBV for an additional 44 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was rapid viral response (RVR), defined as undetectable plasma HCV RNA at week 4. Across all doses, vaniprevir was associated with a rapid two-phase decline in viral load, with HCV RNA levels approximately 3 log(10) IU/mL lower in vaniprevir-treated patients, compared to placebo recipients. Rates of RVR were significantly higher in each of the vaniprevir dose groups, compared to the control regimen (68.8%-83.3% versus 5.6%; P < 0.001 for all comparisons). There were numerically higher, but not statistically significant, early and sustained virologic response rates with vaniprevir, as compared to placebo. Resistance profile was predictable, with variants at R155 and D168 detected in a small number of patients. No relationship between interleukin-28B genotype and treatment outcomes was demonstrated in this study. The incidence of adverse events was generally comparable between vaniprevir and placebo recipients; however, vomiting appeared to be more common at higher vaniprevir doses.\",\"This study explores pretreatment predictive factors for ultimate virological responses to pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 (1.5 \\u03bcg/kg/week) and ribavirin (600-1000 mg/day) (PEG-IFN/RBV) combination therapy for patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-1b and a high viral load.\",\"Several directly acting and host targeting antivirals that inhibit hepatitis C virus replication have entered clinical trials. Among the most advanced of these are RG7128, an inhibitor of the NS5B polymerase; BMS-790052, an inhibitor of NS5A; and alisporivir, an inhibitor of human cyclophilins. These agents have potent antiviral activity in chronic HCV patients, act additively or synergistically with inhibitors of the HCV NS3/4A protease, and improve the rate of virologic response produced by traditional pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy. No cross resistance has been observed; moreover, nucleoside NS5B and cyclophilin inhibitors appear to suppress resistance to non-nucleoside NS5B and NS3/4A inhibitors. Several recent reports of virologic responses produced by combinations of agents that inhibit HCV replication in the absence of interferon provide optimism that eradication of HCV will be possible without interferon in the future.\",\"BI 207127 is a potent non-nucleoside hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase inhibitor in vitro.\",\"Insulin resistance (IR) is induced by chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1 and 4 infections. It is not known whether drugs that affect IR such as Pioglitazone and Prednisone also affect serum HCV RNA titers independently of PEG-Interferon-\\u03b12/ribavirin treatment. The primary aim was to assess whether Pioglitazone by improving IR and/or inflammation decreases HCV viral load independently of standard of care HCV treatment. A secondary aim was to assess whether Prednisone, a drug that induces insulin resistance and stimulates HCV viral entry and replication in replicon culture systems, increases HCV viral load in this population.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects and associates with B cells, leading to abnormal B-cell activation and development of lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disorders. This immune perturbation may in turn be associated with the resistance of HCV against the host immune system. The objective of this study was to analyse the effects of HCV infection of B cells on the efficacy of interferon (IFN)-based therapy. The study enrolled 102 patients with chronic hepatitis C who were treated with pegylated IFN plus ribavirin. HCV RNA titres in B cells were compared in patients with rapid viral responder (RVR) vs non-RVR, sustained viral responder (SVR) vs non-SVR and null viral responder (NVR) vs VR. The levels of HCV RNA in B cells were significantly higher in non-RVR, non-SVR and NVR groups. Association between the therapy outcome and the positive B-cell HCV RNA was also investigated in relation to other known viral and host factors. Multivariable analyses showed that the positive B-cell HCV RNA and the minor single-nucleotide polymorphism near the IL28B gene (rs8099917) were independent factors associated with NVR in patients infected with HCV genotype 1. When these two factors were combined, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for NVR were 92.3%, 98.2%, 92.3% and 98.2%, respectively. Genotype 1 and the presence of one or no mutations in the IFN-sensitivity determining region were associated with higher levels of B-cell HCV RNA. B-cell-tropic HCV appears to have an IFN-resistant phenotype. B-cell HCV RNA positivity is a predictive factor for resistance to IFN-based therapy.\",\"Mericitabine (RG7128), an orally administered prodrug of PSI-6130, is the most clinically advanced nucleoside analogue inhibitor of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of HCV. This review describes what has been learnt so far about the resistance profile of mericitabine. A serine to threonine substitution at position 282 (S282T) of the RdRp that reduces its replication capacity to approximately 15% of wild-type is the only variant that has been consistently generated in serial in vitro passage experiments. To date, no evidence of genotypic resistance to mericitabine has been detected by population or clonal sequence analysis in any baseline or on-treatment samples collected from >600 patients enrolled in Phase I/II trials of mericitabine administered as monotherapy, in combination with pegylated interferon/ribavirin, or in combination with the protease inhibitor, danoprevir, for 14 days in the proof-of-concept study of interferon-free therapy.\",\"Insulin resistance, as measured by surrogate markers, is associated with lower response to hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy and may improve with HCV eradication. We prospectively evaluated the impact of directly measured insulin resistance and abnormal glucose metabolism on achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) with HCV therapy and assessed whether SVR results in improved insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects over 170 million people worldwide and is the most common blood-borne infection in the United States. Standard treatment with peginterferon alfa-ribavirin results in low sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in many patients, especially those who are African-American, are coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or have liver cirrhosis. Because of suboptimal SVR rates, new direct-acting antiviral agents that target HCV viral replication steps are in development. Boceprevir is one of the novel NS3/4A protease inhibitors that was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We evaluated the literature regarding boceprevir by performing a MEDLINE search (January 1996-July 2011) to identify relevant clinical trials. Abstracts and poster and oral presentations from hepatology and HIV conferences were also reviewed. Potent anti-HCV activity was seen in clinical trials with boceprevir when it was studied in HCV genotype 1-infected patients who were na\\u00efve to or had experience with HCV therapy. Data with boceprevir in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients are currently lacking; however, initial data on drug-drug interactions between boceprevir and antiretrovirals have become available. Resistance to boceprevir has been evaluated in trials as well, although more data are needed in this area. The most common adverse events with boceprevir included anemia and dysgeusia. Based on available data, boceprevir is one of the promising novel direct-acting antiviral agents that will likely reshape the treatment of patients with HCV infection.\",\"Insulin resistance is a predictor of poor response to peginterferon/ribavirin in patients infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). There are no data on direct-acting antivirals. This exploratory analysis assessed the effect of metabolic factors and insulin resistance, measured by homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA), on virological response to telaprevir in Study C208.\",\"More than 1% of the Hungarian population is infected with hepatitis B, C, or D viruses. Since 2006 the diagnostics and therapy of these infections are carried out in treatment centers according to national guidelines - since 2010 according to financial protocols. The consensus-based guidelines for 2012 are published in this paper. The guidelines stress the importance of quick and detailed virologic evaluations, the applicability of transient elastography as an acceptable alternative of liver biopsy in this regard, as well as the relevance of appropriate consistent follow up schedule for viral response during therapy. The first choice of therapy in chronic hepatitis B infection is pegylated interferon for 48 weeks or continuous entecavir therapy. The later must be continued for at least 6 months after hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarat is not yet reimbursed by the National Health Insurance Fund. Adefovir dipivoxil is recommended mainly in combination therapy. Lamivudine is no longer a first choice; patients currently taking lamivudine must switch if response is inadequate. Appropriate treatment of patients taking immunosuppressive medications is highly recommended. Pegylated interferon based therapy is recommended for the treatment of concomitant hepatitis D infection. Treatment naive chronic hepatitis C patients should initially receive pegylated interferon and ribavirin dual combination therapy. In genotype 1 infection if response is insufficient at 4 or 12 weeks one of the two new direct acting antivirals (boceprevir or telaprevir) should be added. The length of treatment is usually 48 weeks; in cases of extended early viral response shorter courses are recommended. Previous treatment failure patients with genotype 1 infection should receive a protease inhibitor backed triple combination therapy, mostly for 48 weeks. However, relapsers without cirrhosis and with extended rapid viral response, shorter telaprevir based combination therapy is sufficient. Drug-drug interactions as well as emergence of viral resistance are of particular importance. For genotype 2 or 3 HCV infections 24 weeks, for genotype 4 infections 24, 48 or 72 weeks of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy is recommended in general. The guidelines published here become protocols when published as official publications of the Hungarian Health Authority.\",\"Both viral and host factors influence response to peginterferon-\\u03b1 plus ribavirin (pegIFN\\u03b1/RBV) in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The impact of these variables is more pronounced in HIV/Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected individuals, in whom treatment response rates are lower.\",\"The manner in which ribavirin (RBV) enhances the antiviral effects of interferon (IFN) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains unknown. We investigated whether RBV modifies IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in vivo and in vitro.\",\"Patients with chronic hepatitis C and insulin resistance are less likely to respond to anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy and are at risk for more rapid fibrosis progression. Coadministration of pioglitazone with peginterferon/ribavirin improves insulin sensitivity and increases virologic response rates in insulin-resistant HCV genotype 4 patients, but it is unclear whether this finding applies to genotype 1 patients. For this reason we randomized treatment-naive HCV genotype 1 patients with insulin resistance to receive either standard care (peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin for 48 weeks, n = 73) or pioglitazone 30-45 mg/day plus standard care (n = 77) in an open-label multicenter trial. Patients randomized to pioglitazone received the drug during a 16-week run-in phase, the 48-week standard-care phase, and the 24-week untreated follow-up phase. Pioglitazone treatment improved hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), plasma glucose, insulin levels, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance score and increased serum adiponectin levels during the 16-week run-in phase and maintained these improvements during the standard-care phase. However, we observed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the primary efficacy endpoint, the decrease from baseline to Week 12 of peginterferon alpha-2a/ribavirin treatment in mean log(10) HCV RNA titer (-3.5 \\u00b1 1.71 and -3.7 \\u00b1 1.62 IU/mL in the pioglitazone and standard-care groups, respectively, \\u0394 = 0.21 IU/mL, P = 0.4394).\",\"Pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) therapy is a current standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C. We previously reported that the viral sequence heterogeneity of part of NS5A, referred to as the IFN/RBV resistance-determining region (IRRDR), and a mutation at position 70 of the core protein of hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (HCV-1b) are significantly correlated with the outcome of PEG-IFN/RBV treatment. Here, we aimed to investigate the impact of viral genetic variations within the NS5A and core regions of other genotypes, HCV-2a and HCV-2b, on PEG-IFN/RBV treatment outcome. Pretreatment sequences of NS5A and core regions were analyzed in 112 patients infected with HCV-2a or HCV-2b, who were treated with PEG-IFN/RBV for 24 weeks and followed up for another 24 weeks. The results demonstrated that HCV-2a isolates with 4 or more mutations in IRRDR (IRRDR[2a]\\u22654) was significantly associated with rapid virological response at week 4 (RVR) and sustained virological response (SVR). Also, another region of NS5A that corresponds to part of the IFN sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) plus its carboxy-flanking region, which we referred to as ISDR/+C[2a], was significantly associated with SVR in patients infected with HCV-2a. Multivariate analysis revealed that IRRDR[2a]\\u22654 was the only independent predictive factor for SVR. As for HCV-2b infection, an N-terminal half of IRRDR having two or more mutations (IRRDR[2b]/N\\u22652) was significantly associated with RVR, but not with SVR. No significant correlation was observed between core protein polymorphism and PEG-IFN/RBV treatment outcome in HCV-2a or HCV-2b infection.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) subverts host cholesterol metabolism for key processes in its lifecycle. How this interference results in the frequently observed, genotype-dependent clinical sequelae of hypocholesterolemia, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance (IR) remains incompletely understood. Hypocholesterolemia typically resolves after sustained viral response (SVR), implicating viral interference in host lipid metabolism. Using a targeted cholesterol metabolomic platform we evaluated paired HCV genotype 2 (G2) and G3 patient sera for changes in in vivo HCV sterol pathway metabolites. We compared HCV genotypic differences in baseline metabolites and following antiviral treatment to assess whether sterol perturbation resolved after HCV eradication. We linked these metabolites to IR and urine oxidative stress markers. In paired sera from HCV G2 (n = 13) and G3 (n = 20) patients, baseline sterol levels were lower in G3 than G2 for distal metabolites (7-dehyrocholesterol (7DHC) 0.017 versus 0.023 mg/dL; P(adj) = 0.0524, cholesterol 140.9 versus 178.7 mg/dL; P(adj) = 0.0242) but not the proximal metabolite lanosterol. In HCV G3, SVR resulted in increased levels of distal metabolites (cholesterol [\\u039455.2 mg/dL; P(adj) = 0.0015], 7DHC [\\u03940.0075 mg/dL; P(adj) = 0.0026], lathosterol [\\u03940.0430 mg/dL P(adj) = 0.0405]). In contrast, lanosterol was unchanged after SVR (P = 0.9515).\",\"There are two classes of anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) agents currently in development: direct-acting antivirals (DAA) and host-targeting antivirals (HTA). Cyclophilin inhibitor alisporivir (ALV) , previously known as Debio-025 is the most advanced HTA in development.\",\"Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) suppressive therapy using acyclovir (ACV) or valacyclovir in HIV-1/HSV-2-infected persons increased the patient's survival and decreased the HIV-1 load. It has been shown that the incorporation of ACV-monophosphate into the nascent DNA chain instead of dGMP results in the termination of viral DNA elongation and directly inhibits laboratory strains of HIV-1. We evaluated here the anti-HIV activity of ACV against primary HIV-1 isolates of different clades and coreceptor specificity and against viral isolates resistant to currently used drugs, including zidovudine, lamivudine, nevirapine, a combination of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), a fusion inhibitor, and two protease inhibitors. We found that, at clinically relevant concentrations, ACV inhibits the replication of these isolates in human tissues infected ex vivo. Moreover, addition of ribavirin, an antiviral capable of depleting the pool of intracellular dGTP, potentiated the ACV-mediated HIV-1 suppression. These data warrant further clinical investigations of the benefits of using inexpensive and safe ACV alone or in combination with other drugs against HIV-1, especially to complement or delay highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation in low-resource settings.\",\"Only about 50% of patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 achieve a successful response to standard treatment with pegylated interferon-alfa and ribavirin. Moreover, the recently approved protease inhibitors will have to be administered together with these drugs. Consequently, predicting response to standard treatment, ideally before starting it, remains an important challenge. Although several baseline predictors of treatment failure have been described, including clinical and virological factors, none of them is able to provide reliable predictions at the individual level. In addition, the development of multivariate models combining several predictive factors has not yet yielded predictions with the requisite reliability for use in clinical practice. Therefore, further research is needed to improve predictive models and to describe new factors that would enable us to predict treatment outcome with greater reliability and reproducibility. The development of candidate selection algorithms that help clinicians to identify which patients could benefit from the new therapies on the basis of their chances of responding to standard therapy is of major interest for both patient well-being and healthcare expense. This review attempts to provide a view of the current options for predicting the response to pegylated interferon-alfa plus ribavirin therapy in patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1.\",\"Data concerning the influence of insulin resistance (IR) and ethnicity on early phases of viral kinetics after initiation of peginterferon plus ribavirin in treatment-naive, chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients are limited.\",\"The limited efficacy of existing antiviral therapies for influenza--coupled with widespread baseline antiviral resistance--highlights the urgent need for more effective therapy. We describe a triple combination antiviral drug (TCAD) regimen composed of amantadine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin that is highly efficacious at reducing mortality and weight loss in mouse models of influenza infection. TCAD therapy was superior to dual and single drug regimens in mice infected with drug-susceptible, low pathogenic A/H5N1 (A/Duck/MN/1525/81) and amantadine-resistant 2009 A/H1N1 influenza (A/California/04/09). Treatment with TCAD afforded >90% survival in mice infected with both viruses, whereas treatment with dual and single drug regimens resulted in 0% to 60% survival. Importantly, amantadine had no activity as monotherapy against the amantadine-resistant virus, but demonstrated dose-dependent protection in combination with oseltamivir and ribavirin, indicative that amantadine's activity had been restored in the context of TCAD therapy. Furthermore, TCAD therapy provided survival benefit when treatment was delayed until 72 hours post-infection, whereas oseltamivir monotherapy was not protective after 24 hours post-infection. These findings demonstrate in vivo efficacy of TCAD therapy and confirm previous reports of the synergy and broad spectrum activity of TCAD therapy against susceptible and resistant influenza strains in vitro.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors combined with pegylated alfa interferon-ribavirin have demonstrated improved efficacy compared with pegylated alfa interferon-ribavirin alone for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Asunaprevir (BMS-650032), a novel HCV NS3 protease inhibitor in clinical development, was evaluated for safety, antiviral activity, and resistance in four double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential-panel, single- and multiple-ascending-dose (SAD and MAD) studies in healthy subjects or subjects with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection. In SAD studies, subjects (healthy or with chronic HCV infection) were randomized to receive asunaprevir in dose groups of 10 to 1,200 mg or a placebo. In MAD studies, healthy subjects were randomized to receive asunaprevir in dose groups of 10 to 600 mg twice daily or a placebo for 14 days; subjects with HCV infection received asunaprevir in dose groups of 200 to 600 mg twice daily, or a placebo, for 3 days. Across all four studies, headache and diarrhea were the most frequent adverse events in asunaprevir recipients. Asunaprevir at doses of 200 to 600 mg resulted in rapid HCV RNA decreases from the baseline; maximal mean changes in HCV RNA over time were 2.7 and 3.5 log(10) IU/ml in the SAD and MAD studies, respectively. No enrichment of signature asunaprevir-resistant viral variants was detected. In conclusion, the novel NS3 protease inhibitor asunaprevir, when administered at single or multiple doses of 200 to 600 mg twice daily, is generally well tolerated, achieving rapid and substantial decreases in HCV RNA levels in subjects chronically infected with genotype 1 HCV.\",\"ITX 5061 is a scavenger receptor B1 antagonist that has entered phase 1 clinical trials in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected humans. We evaluated ITX 5061 in combination with interferon-\\u03b1, ribavirin, and HCV protease and polymerase inhibitors in a genotype 2a infectious virus system. ITX 5061 is a potent inhibitor of HCV replication and is additive to synergistic with interferon-\\u03b1, ribavirin, BILN2061, VX950, VX1, and 2'-C-methyladenosine. Resistance selection experiments were performed using a Jc1-FEO virus co-culture system and intermittent ITX 5061 exposure under neomycin selection. We identified a mutant virus with a substitution of aspartic acid for asparagine at the highly conserved position 415 in E2 (N415D). Introduction of this mutation into wild-type virus conferred high-level resistance to ITX 5061. There was no cross-resistance between ITX 5061 and HCV protease inhibitors or interferon-\\u03b1. These results suggest that ITX 5061 is a promising compound for study in combination with other HCV inhibitors.\",\"The role of insulin resistance in predicting virological response to therapy of chronic hepatitis C is debated. We assessed the association between basal (defined as homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)>2) and post-load insulin resistance (as oral glucose insulin sensitivity index<9.8 mg/kg/min) with the rapid and sustained virological responses in chronic hepatitis C.\",\"The launch of first-generation protease inhibitors (PIs) was a major step forward in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment. However, this major advance has, up to now, only been applicable to genotype-1 patients. Second-wave and second-generation PIs appear to achieve higher antiviral potency, with pan-genotype activities, fewer side-effects and potential activity against PI-resistant mutation by second-generation PIs, through more convenient daily administration. Other direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) include NS5B inhibitors such as nucleoside/nucleotide inhibitors (NIs) and non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNIs). NIs have similar efficacy across all genotypes and present with the highest barrier to resistance of all DAAs to date. PSI-7977, a pyrimidine nucleotide analogue, also has highly potent antiviral activity across all HCV genotypes. In combination with ribavirin in an interferon-free regimen, it can achieve a 100% sustained viral response (SVR) rate in genotype 2/3 treatment-na\\u00efve patients. In association with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PR), it achieves an SVR of 91% in genotype-1 na\\u00efve patients. NNIs in association with PR appear to be less potent, but they may nonetheless play a key role in many of the combination trials including either PIs or NIs. NS5A inhibitors also exhibit highly potent antiviral activity. Evaluation of their activity in combination with PIs demonstrated for the first time that an interferon-free regimen can cure genotype-1b null-responder patients. Furthermore, quadruple therapy with PR can achieve a 100% SVR in genotype-1 null-responder patients. Other players in the field, such as cyclophilin inhibitors and therapeutic vaccines, may have a role in combination with DAAs. The near future of HCV treatment looks promising. However, whether or not DAA combinations will lead to an interferon-free regimen for all patients remains an open question.\",\"Around 50% of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive patients infected with genotype 1 are nonresponders to the combination of pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and ribavirin, including relapsers, and partial and null responders and, as such, are exposed to the risk of progression to cirrhosis and its complications, resulting in HCV-related morbidity and mortality. Repeat treatment using the same combination in such patients results in <5% viral eradication and there are no therapeutic prospects for patients who fail, as maintenance therapy has not proved efficacious. The triple association of direct-acting antivirals specific of HCV, and especially the first-generation protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir, increases this percentage to around 65%, with variations according to the previous response to therapy of patients (85% of relapsers, 50% of partial responders and 30% of null responders). These encouraging results extend the therapeutic indications and costs of therapy during virological follow-up, and influence the rules of discontinuation. Information on the management of these new molecules also allows a larger number of patients to be cured and reduces the occurrence of viral resistance. Thus, the aim of the present review is to summarize the efficacy of the triple association of pegIFN, ribavirin and telaprevir or boceprevir in treatment-experienced patients who failed to respond to dual pegIFN and ribavirin therapy.\",\"The treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has substantially evolved over the past decade, following the Consensus Conference organized by the European Association for the Study of the Liver in 1999. Since then, the standard of care (SoC) for patients with chronic hepatitis C has been the combination of pegylated interferon (pegIFN) alpha-2a or -2b and ribavirin. In patients infected with HCV genotype 1, by far the most frequent HCV genotype worldwide, such treatment leads to a cure of infection in only 40-50% of cases. After a decade in which pegIFN alpha and ribavirin therapy was the only available option, triple therapy with HCV protease inhibitors (PIs; boceprevir and telaprevir) in combination with pegIFN alpha and ribavirin has become the new SoC for genotype-1-infected patients. With PI therapy, higher cure rates can be achieved, but specific issues are also raised, such as the emergence of resistance to PIs. For this reason, the present report examines the antiviral activity of PIs and what is currently known about resistance to them, while focusing on telaprevir and boceprevir, two HCV PIs recently licensed for the treatment of treatment-na\\u00efve and treatment-experienced genotype-1 patients with chronic hepatitis C. The clinical relevance of resistance testing is also discussed.\",\"Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have not had a response to therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin may benefit from the addition of multiple direct-acting antiviral agents to their treatment regimen.\",\"About half of the patients with chronic hepatitis C are still not cured by treatment with the current standard of care, peginterferon \\u03b1/ribavirin. Direct antiviral drugs may overcome the limitations of standard antiviral therapy. The most promising new agents are inhibitors of the NS3/4A protease, the NS5B polymerase and the NS5A protein. Several compounds against these targets have entered clinical evaluation. Early clinical trials have emphasized the high potential for selecting resistant Hepatitis C virus variants. Furthermore, development of several new direct antivirals was stopped because of concerns over tolerability and safety. Then, in 2010, two phase III trials with the NS3/4A protease inhibitors boceprevir (SPRINT-2) and telaprevir (ADVANCE) showed that the combination of these compounds with standard care increases sustained virologic response rates in treatment-na\\u00efve genotype 1 patients from 38-44% to 66-75%. Future goals of therapy with direct antiviral agents are to improve tolerability, shorten the duration of therapy and overcome the issue of resistance. Several studies have been initiated that combine different novel therapies, with and without interferon \\u03b1/ribavirin.\",\"The combination of pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 plus ribavirin (pegIFN\\u03b1-RBV) has been the only therapeutic option for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection during the last decade. Unfortunately, it provides cure to less than a half of individuals infected with HCV genotype 1, which is by far the most prevalent worldwide. The recent introduction of new direct-acting antivirals (DAA) has revolutionized the hepatitis C field. The addition of any of the two recently approved HCV protease inhibitors, boceprevir or telaprevir, to pegIFN\\u03b1-RBV results in the cure for two-thirds of HCV genotype 1, interferon-naive patients.\",\"Mutations located in the 109-amino acid fragment of NS5B are typically associated with resistance to interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RIB) and to new antiviral drugs. The prevalence of these mutations was examined in 69 drug-na\\u00efve individuals with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Mutations related to non-response to IFN/RIB were observed in all subtypes studied (1a, 1b, 2b, 3a and 4). The most common mutation was Q309R, present in all subtypes, except subtype 2b with frequency above 20%. D244N was detected only in subtype 3a and A333E was detected only in subtype 2b. We did not detect the S282T, S326G or T329I mutations in any of the samples analysed. Of note, the C316N mutation, previously related to a new non-nucleoside compound (HCV796 and AG-021541), was observed in only eight of 33 (24%) samples from subtype 1b. Site 316 was under positive selection in this HCV variant. Our data highlight the presence of previously described resistance mutations in HCV genotypes from drug-na\\u00efve patients.\",\"Antiviral effect of interferon is mediated by the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, because of the difficulty in obtaining paired liver biopsies before and after interferon treatment, the key ISGs expressed in human hepatocytes and responsible for interferon-based antiviral activities in chronic hepatitis C remain illusive. Prior to a standard course of peginterferon plus ribavirin therapy, 104 patients underwent a liver biopsy. A small piece of the liver biopsy sample from each patient was submitted for ex vivo tissue culture in the presence or absence of interferon. Hepatic expression of 8 ISGs was detected by RT-PCR. The ISG expression patterns and clinicopathological variables were correlated with subsequent treatment outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hepatic MxA expression (P = 0.008) and leucocyte count (P = 0.040) independently predicted the end of therapeutic virological response, while hepatic OAS1 expression (P = 0.003), genotype 1 (P = 0.002), HCV-RNA level (P = 0.007), AST/ALT ratio (P = 0.004) and leucocyte count (P = 0.034) independently predicted the sustained virological response. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that interferon-induced OAS1 expression localized to the hepatocytes. In conclusion, hepatic MxA and OAS1 expression predicted, respectively, the end of therapeutic and sustained virological responses in interferon-based treatment of chronic hepatitis C.\",\"Obesity and insulin resistance have been reported as negative predictors for sustained virological response (SVR) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infected patients treated with pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 plus ribavirin. They are also known to affect serum levels of several cytokines including adipocytokines. But the association between these cytokines and treatment outcome has not been fully elucidated. We examined pretreatment serum levels of 14 cytokines among 190 patients who were treated with pegylated interferon-\\u03b1-2b plus ribavirin for chronic HCV-1b infection with high viral load (\\u2265 5 log IU/mL) and analyzed their contribution to treatment response. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), vascular endothelial growth factor, and 11 clinical factors showed significant association with SVR in univariate logistic regression analysis. Four significant factors in multivariate analysis; serum PAI-1 (odds ratio [OR] = 15.42), body mass index (OR = 4.56), rs8099917 (OR = 4.95) and fibrosis stage (OR = 5.18) were identified as independent predictors. We constructed a simple and minimally invasive prediction score for SVR based on the presence of these factors except for fibrosis stage. The accuracy of this score was 73%, and was confirmed using an independent validation cohort consisting of 31 patients (68%). The strongest correlation was between PAI-1 level and platelet count (r = 0.38, P = 1.8 \\u00d7 10(-7)), and PAI-1 level was inversely correlated with fibrosis stage. Serum PAI-1 is a novel predictor for the response to combination therapy against chronic HCV-1b infection and may be associated with liver fibrosis.\",\"Telaprevir in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin is a promising advancement in chronic hepatitis C treatment. However, the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antiviral profiles of telaprevir alone beyond 2 weeks have not been studied.\",\"Despite years of clinical use and extensive research efforts, the mechanism of action of ribavirin (RBV) is not well understood. Although it has only a mild, transient antiviral effect on HCV replication when administered as monotherapy, when combined with interferon, RBV improves sustained virological response (SVR) rates by approximately 25-30%. Proposed mechanisms of action for RBV against HCV include (1) a direct effect against the HCV RNA dependent RNA polymerase; (2) induction of misincorporation of nucleotides leading to lethal mutagenesis; (3) depletion of intracellular pools via inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase; (4) alteration in the cytokine balance between a Th2 profile (anti-inflammatory) to a Th1 profile (pro-inflammatory); and (5) potentiating the effect of interferon via up-regulation of genes involved in interferon signalling. Given the lack of a clear understanding of RBV mechanism of action, it has been challenging to confidently position this drug with new direct antiviral agents (DAA). However, early clinical studies provide strong evidence for a benefit of RBV in combination with DAAs for both IFN containing and sparing regimens. The addition of RBV reduces viral breakthroughs and/or relapses, at least when drugs with low to moderate genetic barriers to resistance are paired together. This is particularly true in patients harbouring HCV subtype 1a. Ongoing studies are now addressing the utility of RBV in nucleoside containing DAA regimens, which offer both potent antiviral activity as well as a high genetic barrier to resistance. It is remarkable that the age-old question of the role of RBV in the future of HCV therapy remains as real today as it was two decades ago.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C is one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease with approximately 170 million people infected worldwide. Sustained virological response (SVR) is equivalent to viral eradication and associated with a reduction in the risk of cirrhosis. Nowadays the treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 chronic infection is the addition of direct acting antivirals (DAA) with a protease inhibitor (telaprevir or boceprevir) to the pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) regimen. The future management of patients with these new molecules will require good clinical practice, knowledge of indications, management of side effects and monitoring for antiviral resistance. Certain major medical needs are still unmet and require studies in special populations (HIV-HCV coinfected patients, transplanted patients, etc.\\u2026) and also in HCV non-1 genotype patients and in non-responders. Second generation DAA are in development. Combinations of antivirals with additive potency that lack cross resistance and with a good safety profile may provide new regimens in the future to make HCV the first chronic viral infection eradicated worldwide with a finite duration of combination DAA therapy without IFN. The aim of this review is to summarize mechanisms of action and results obtained with DAAs.\",\"This is an excellent time for patients with hepatitis C virus infection who have failed past treatment with standard of care (SOC) peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). New treatments have been shown to increase sustained virological response (SVR) rates. Previous relapsers and those with some responsiveness to interferon will clearly benefit from protease inhibitor-based therapy. Patients with little interferon response may not be suited for these regimens, but can be treated by careful selection on a case-by-case basis. Resistance needs to be carefully monitored as these newer and more potent drugs are added to IFN and RBV backbone drugs. Adverse events will be more frequent and will require special attention.\",\"Treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has evolved considerably in the last few years. Combination therapy with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)-\\u03b1 plus ribavirin (RBV) has been the standard of care (SoC) treatment in the past few years. Several viral and host factors have been associated with treatment failure, including age, male gender, ethnicity, genotype, IL28B genotype, steatosis, obesity and insulin resistance. Several studies have also shown that in patients who fail treatment, several interferon-stimulated genes are upregulated before treatment. Recently, the NS3/4A protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir have been approved and are considered the new SoC therapy in combination with PEG-IFN-\\u03b1/RBV in HCV genotype 1 treatment-na\\u00efve patients, as well as in previously treated patients, with significant improvements in SVR rates. The REALIZE phase III trial with telaprevir in previously treated patients showed SVR rates of 83-88% in prior relapsers, 54-58% in prior partial responders and, 29-33% in prior non-responders.\",\"Telaprevir is a potent HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor. A completed development program has demonstrated the superior efficacy of a regimen of telaprevir combined with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin (PR) over PR alone in patients with HCV genotype 1. In the ADVANCE trial in treatment-na\\u00efve patients, 12 weeks of telaprevir, peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin followed by either 12 or 36 weeks of PR alone (depending upon extended rapid virologic response, or eRVR, i.e. HCV RNA undetectability at weeks 4 and 12), was associated with sustained virological response (SVR) in 75% of patients compared with 46% receiving PR for 48 weeks. The ILLUMINATE trial established the foundation for response-guided therapy in patients with eRVR. The REALIZE trial in treatment-experienced patients showed a gradient of SVR from prior relapsers (86%) to partial responders (57%) to null responders (31%), with rates of virologic failure and emergent resistance highest in the latter group. Incremental adverse effects of telaprevir include rash, anemia, pruritus, diarrhea, and nausea. Treatment na\\u00efve patients and relapsers are eligible for response-guided therapy. Stopping rules of telaprevir-based treatment include HCV RNA > 1000 IU/ml at weeks 4 and 12.\",\"Until recently, chronic hepatitis C caused by persistent infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been treated with a combination of pegylated interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN\\u03b1) and ribavirin (RBV). This situation has changed with the development of two drugs targeting the NS3/4A protease, approved for combination therapy with PEG-IFN\\u03b1/RBV for patients infected with genotype 1 viruses. Moreover, two additional viral proteins, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (residing in NS5B) and the NS5A protein have emerged as promising drug targets and a large number of antivirals targeting these proteins are at different stages of clinical development. Although this progress is very promising, it is not clear whether these new compounds will suffice to eradicate the virus in an infected individual, ideally by using a PEG-IFN\\u03b1/RBV-free regimen, or whether additional compounds targeting other factors that promote HCV replication are required. In this respect, host cell factors have emerged as a promising alternative. They reduce the risk of development of antiviral resistance and they increase the chance for broad-spectrum activity, ideally covering all HCV genotypes. Work in the last few years has identified several host cell factors used by HCV for productive replication. These include, amongst others, cyclophilins, especially cyclophilinA (cypA), microRNA-122 (miR-122) or phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase III alpha. For instance, cypA inhibitors have shown to be effective in combination therapy with PEG-IFN/RBV in increasing the sustained viral response (SVR) rate significantly compared to PEG-IFN/RBV. This review briefly summarizes recent advances in the development of novel antivirals against HCV.\",\"Widespread resistance among circulating influenza A strains to at least one of the anti-influenza drugs is a major public health concern. A triple combination antiviral drug (TCAD) regimen comprised of amantadine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin has been shown to have synergistic and broad spectrum activity against influenza A strains, including drug resistant strains. Here, we used mathematical modeling along with three different experimental approaches to understand the effects of single agents, double combinations, and the TCAD regimen on resistance in influenza in vitro, including: 1) serial passage at constant drug concentrations, 2) serial passage at escalating drug concentrations, and 3) evaluation of the contribution of each component of the TCAD regimen to the suppression of resistance. Consistent with the modeling which demonstrated that three drugs were required to suppress the emergence of resistance in influenza A, treatment with the TCAD regimen resulted in the sustained suppression of drug resistant viruses, whereas treatment with amantadine alone or the amantadine-oseltamivir double combination led to the rapid selection of resistant variants which comprised \\u223c100% of the population. Furthermore, the TCAD regimen imposed a high genetic barrier to resistance, requiring multiple mutations in order to escape the effects of all the drugs in the regimen. Finally, we demonstrate that each drug in the TCAD regimen made a significant contribution to the suppression of virus breakthrough and resistance at clinically achievable concentrations. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the TCAD regimen was superior to double combinations and single agents at suppressing resistance, and that three drugs at a minimum were required to impede the selection of drug resistant variants in influenza A virus. The use of mathematical modeling with multiple experimental designs and molecular readouts to evaluate and optimize combination drug regimens for the suppression of resistance may be broadly applicable to other infectious diseases.\",\"To explore mutations around the interferon sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) which are associated with the resistance of hepatitis C virus 1b (HCV-1b) to interferon-\\u03b1 treatment.\",\"The current standard of care for hepatitis C infection is peginterferon/ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV). We are entering the era where direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) will be added to PegIFN/RBV, leading to higher sustained response rates in genotype 1 infected individuals. Currently DAAs are directed toward specific proteins involved in hepatitis C replication with NS3/NS4A protease inhibitors furthest in development. Telaprevir and boceprevir are both NS3/NS4a inhibitors that significantly improve sustained response when added to PegIFN and RBV. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) polymerase inhibitors are another promising DAA class. These molecules are divided into nucleoside/nucleotide polymerase inhibitors and nonnucleotide/nucleoside polymerase inhibitors. Nucleoside/nucleotide polymerase inhibitors have a high barrier to resistance and appear to be effective across a broad range of genotypes. Nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitors have a lower barrier of resistance and appear to be genotype specific. Preliminary data with these compounds are also promising. A third class, NS5A inhibitors, has also shown potent HCV RNA suppression in preliminary studies as monotherapy and with PegIFN and RBV. Combinations of these agents are also entering clinical trials and indeed a preliminary report has demonstrated that the combination of an NS3/4A protease inhibitor and NS5B polymerase inhibitor can effectively suppress virus in genotype 1 individuals. Future studies will concentrate on combinations of direct-acting antiviral agents without and with PegIFN and RBV. Clinicians will need to be familiar with managing side effects as well as resistance as we enter this new era.\",\"Double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) together with interferon (IFN) administration produces a substantial reduction in the viral load during the early stages of treatment.\",\"Insulin resistance (IR) has been reported to be an independent predictor of treatment outcome in chronic hepatitis C patients.\",\"Combination therapy of pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 with ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) is a standard of care for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The majority of CHC patients are infected with HCV genotype I. The recent discovery revealed by a genome-wide association study technology provides the important role of interleukin-28B (IL28B) and inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) in HCV infection. In addition, response to PEG-IFN/RBV therapy is correlated with insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic fibrosis in CHC patients. Double-filtration plasmapheresis together with IFN therapy has proved to be effective in the reduction of viral load during the early stage of treatment. In CHC patients, not only IL28B status, but also the treatment period of PEG-IFN/RBV is important. Even when new polymerase/protease inhibitors are introduced in the treatment of CHC, tailor-made treatment for CHC using IL28B, inosine triphosphatase testing or double-filtration plasmapheresis treatment prolonged treatment strategy is highly recommended. The relative etiologic role of prior hepatitis B virus infection in the development of non-B non-C hepatocellular carcinoma is also known in hepatitis B-endemic areas.\",\"The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, safety, drug interactions, viral drug resistance, dosage and administration, and place in therapy of telaprevir are reviewed.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major and rising global health problem, affecting about 170 million people worldwide. The current standard of care treatment with interferon alpha and ribavirin in patients with the genotype 1 infection, the most frequent genotype in the USA and Western Europe, leads to a successful outcome in only about 50% of individuals. Accurate prediction of hepatitis C treatment response is of great benefit to patients and clinicians. The informational spectrum method, a virtual spectroscopy method for structure/function analysis of nucleotide and protein sequences, is applied here for the identification of the conserved information of the HCV proteins that correlate with the combination therapy outcome. Among the HCV proteins that we have analyzed the informational property of the p7 of HCV genotype 1b was best related to the therapy outcome. On the basis of these results, a simple bioinformatics criterion that could be useful in assessment of the response of HCV-infected patients to the combination therapy has been proposed.\",\"With the approval in 2011 of the protease inhibitors Victrelis and Incivek, direct-acting antivirals have begun to revolutionize HCV treatment. Although the addition of Incivek or Victrelis to PEGylated IFN\\u03b1 and ribavarin (pIFN\\u03b1/RBV) may improve cure rates and shorten the treatment duration of the \\\"old\\\" standard of care (SOC), this triple therapy will not be suitable for patients intolerant to pIFN\\u03b1 or RBV. The efficacy of this triple therapy will also certainly be attenuated in pIFN\\u03b1/RBV non-responders. As Incivek is inactive against genotype 3 (GT3) combined with the fact that all protease inhibitors and most of the non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors in development are active primarily against GT1, pIFN\\u03b1/RBV will remain the SOC for non-GT1 until new classes of inhibitors enter into clinical practice. GT1 patients who do not respond to this new triple therapy will have developed resistance to protease inhibitors that will limit future treatment options. There is thus an important need for the identification of new potent HCV agents. A novel class of HCV inhibitors that have great potential for the treatment for HCV has recently emerged: the host-targeting antivirals cyclophilin inhibitors.\",\"Direct-acting antiviral agents in combination with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) significantly improve sustained virologic response rate and reduce duration of therapy among both treatment-na\\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C. One of the most important considerations with both boceprevir and telaprevir is the potential development of resistant variants with therapy. Patients with poor intrinsic responsiveness to interferon, and those with incomplete virological suppression on protease inhibitor therapy, appear to be at higher risk for resistance. In this article we will define antiviral resistance and review the data on both in vitro and in vivo resistance to protease inhibitors, concentrating on data on boceprevir and telaprevir. We will also explore the significance of resistant variants present at the baseline, as well as the fate of the resistant variants and the ways to minimize the development of resistance to protease inhibitors.\",\"Recent approval of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) offers a major advance in the management of HCV infection. These DAAs, boceprevir and telaprevir, when given with pegylated interferon alfa (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), result in a much higher sustained virologic response rate compared with Peg-IFN and RBV. The DAA-containing regimens are approved for HCV genotype 1 infection in HCV treatment-naive and HCV treatment-experienced patients. In this review, we present an overview of pharmacology, efficacy, adverse events, and emergence of resistance-associated variants with the use of these agents. As with all drugs, especially newly approved drugs, clinicians must consult the package insert for detailed prescribing information, list of all reported adverse events, contraindications, and drug interactions.\",\"Boceprevir and telaprevir are the first HCV protease inhibitors to be approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection. These drugs must be used in combination with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (P/R) to maximize efficacy and prevent the emergence of resistance-associated variants (RAVs). In randomized, placebo-controlled international studies in treatment-naive and previously treated HCV patients, treatment with either boceprevir- or telaprevir-based triple therapy regimens significantly increased sustained virological response rates compared with placebo plus P/R. Protease inhibitors have the potential, not only to significantly increase cure rates among patients with genotype 1 infection, but also to reduce the duration of treatment for patients who have an extended rapid virological response. Boceprevir is associated with an increased incidence of anaemia and dysgeusia and telaprevir is associated with an increased incidence of rash and anaemia. The emergence of RAVs was associated with an increased risk of virological failure in clinical studies. Although these new drugs bring significant promise, it remains unclear if all genotype 1 patients will need triple therapy. Here, we review some of the complexities uncovered and controversies highlighted by the introduction of HCV protease inhibitors.\",\"Although several direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are now available, the therapy regimen for chronic hepatitis C will continue to include pegylated interferon and ribavirin for the foreseeable future. Despite their improved rate of sustained virological response (SVR), DAAs pose increased risks of side effects and selection for antiviral resistance. Not all patients require DAA to achieve SVR, whereas others are unlikely to respond even to triple therapy. Therefore, a personalized approach to candidate selection is necessary.\",\"Advances in hepatitis C pharmacogenomics identified modulations of a sustained virologic response (SVR) by frequent IL28B gene variants and of ribavirin-induced hemolysis by frequent ITPA gene variants. These associations have been widely reproduced in various ethnicities, clinical settings and hepatitis C viral genotypes. The IL28B minor alleles rs8099917G, rs12979860T and rs12980275G have been associated with non-SVR whereas the ITPA minor alleles rs1127354A and rs7270101C were associated with less hemolytic side effects, an effect also attributed to a nucleoside transporter gene SLC28A3 rs10868138G/rs56350726T haplotype. The significance levels of these associations, especially in genome-wide studies, were very high. We nevertheless tested how good clinical outcomes of peginterferon \\u03b1/ribavirin therapy, such as SVR or hemolytic side effects, were predicted by these variants. An analysis in an example dataset of 115 patients revealed that the prediction of non-SVR or hemolysis by single variants was often only slightly better than guessing. Using combinations of IL28B variants provided a higher accuracy (64.5%) of predicting non-SVR than with single IL28B variants (accuracy 60-63%). Similarly, a decline in blood hemoglobin by \\u22653 g/dl could be better predicted at an accuracy of 70% (10% better than guessing) with a combination of an ITPA variant with a nucleoside transporter gene (SLC28A3) haplotype. Thus, genotyping information about single IL28B or ITPA variants is reproducibly and statistically significantly associated with hepatitis C therapy outcomes; however, the clinical predictive utility of single variants can be increased by combinations of genotypes.\",\"Telaprevir is an NS3/4A protease inhibitor that has recently received US FDA approval for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. Telaprevir is given in combination with peg-IFN-\\u03b1 and ribavirin and is indicated for both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients with genotype 1 infection. Along with the other first generation NS3/4A protease inhibitor boceprevir, these combination regimens have immediately become the standard of care for genotype 1 patients. The adverse event profile for the combination regimen remains dominated by peg-IFN-\\u03b1 and ribavirin, but there is additional anemia and rash with telaprevir. Owing to telaprevir's metabolism by the CYP3/4A pathway, drug-drug interactions could lead to toxicity from other medications or decreased efficacy of telaprevir. Viral resistance can develop during treatment with telaprevir, and patients will need to be educated on their role in adherence to minimize the risk of resistance and improve their chances of cure of HCV infection.\",\"The nucleoside analogue Ribavirin significantly increases patient response to IFN-\\u03b1 treatment of HCV, by directly inhibiting viral replication. Recent studies indicate that Ribavirin also regulates immunity and we propose that Ribavirin enhances specific interferon sensitive gene (ISG) expression by amplifying the IFN-\\u03b1-JAK/STAT pathway. We found that IFN-\\u03b1-induced STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation was increased in hepatocytes co-treated with Ribavirin and IFN-\\u03b1, compared to IFN-\\u03b1 alone. Ribavirin specifically enhanced IFN-\\u03b1 induced mRNA and protein of the anti-viral mediator MxA, which co-localised with HCV core protein. These novel findings indicate for the first time that Ribavirin, in addition to its viral incorporation, also enhances IFN-\\u03b1-JAK/STAT signalling, leading to a novel MxA-mediated immuno-modulatory mechanism that may enhance IFN-\\u03b1 anti-viral activity against HCV.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) exhibits a high level of genetic variability, and variants with reduced susceptibility to antivirals can occur even before treatment begins. In addition, alcohol decreases efficacy of antiviral therapy and increases sequence heterogeneity of HCV RNA but how ethanol affects HCV sequence is unknown. Ethanol metabolism and HCV infection increase the level of reactive species that can alter cell metabolism, modify signaling, and potentially act as mutagen to the viral RNA. Therefore, we investigated whether ethanol and reactive species affected the basal sequence variability of HCV RNA in hepatocytes. Human hepatoma cells supporting a continuous replication of genotype 1b HCV RNA (Con1, AJ242652) were exposed to ethanol, acetaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, or L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO) that decreases intracellular glutathione as seen in patients. Then, NS5A region was sequenced and compared with genotype 1b HCV sequences in the database. Ethanol and BSO elevated nucleotide and amino acid substitution rates of HCV RNA by 4-18 folds within 48 hrs which were accompanied by oxidative RNA damage. Iron chelator and glutathione ester decreased both RNA damage and mutation rates. Furthermore, infectious HCV and HCV core gene were sufficient to induce oxidative RNA damage even in the absence of ethanol or BSO. Interestingly, the dn/ds ratio and percentage of sites undergoing positive selection increased with ethanol and BSO, resulting in an increased detection of NS5A variants with reduced susceptibility to interferon alpha, cyclosporine, and ribavirin and others implicated in immune tolerance and modulation of viral replication. Therefore, alcohol is likely to synergize with virus-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress to modulate the basal mutation rate of HCV. Positive selection induced by alcohol and reactive species may contribute to antiviral resistance.\",\"Interleukin (IL)-6, a pleiotropic cytokine, is increased in various types of chronic liver disease, including chronic hepatitis C (CHC). It was reported recently that IL-6 is associated with insulin resistance, iron metabolism and interferon resistance, which may affect the outcome of antiviral treatment. In this study, we investigated the association of serum IL-6 levels with outcomes of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy.\",\"Protease inhibitor (PI)-resistant hepatitis C virus (HCV) variants may be present in substantial numbers in PI-untreated patients according to recent reports. However, influence of these viruses in the clinical course of chronic hepatitis C has not been well characterized.\",\"The IL28B genotype is the most important pretreatment predictor of treatment outcome in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The impact of the rs12979860 genotype on relapse was retrospectively evaluated in genotype 1/4 patients who received response-guided therapy with peginterferon alpha-2a 180 \\u03bcg/week plus ribavirin 1,000/1,200 mg/day in a large, randomized, multicenter study. Patients with a rapid virologic response (RVR: hepatitis C virus [HCV] RNA <50 IU/mL) at week 4 were treated for 24 weeks; those with a slow virologic response (no RVR but undetectable HCV RNA or \\u2265 2-log(10) decrease at week 12) were randomized to 48 (group A) or 72 weeks of treatment (group B). Relapse rates were compared by rs12979860 genotype (C/C versus combined T/C or T/T [T/*]) in patients with confirmed end-of-treatment response and known end-of-follow-up status (sustained virologic response [SVR] or relapse). The rs12979860 genotype was determined for 340/551 study participants. In patients with RVR and C/C or T/* genotype, relapse rates were similar (10.7% versus 15.2%). In patients randomized to groups A and B, relapse rates were similar in patients with C/C genotype randomized to group A (26.9%) and group B (20.0%). In contrast, relapse rates in T/* patients differed markedly between groups A and B, overall (42.9% and 18.8%; P < 0.025, respectively) and in those with low (<400,000 IU/mL: 37.5% versus 18.8%) and high (\\u2265 400,000 IU/mL: 45.0% versus 18.8%) baseline viral loads.\",\"The approval of the first direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs for treatment of HCV in 2011 has lead to improved sustained viral response rates of up to 79% in treatment-na\\u00efve or relapse genotype 1 patients.\",\"More than 20 years after the identification of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a novel human pathogen, the only approved treatment remains a combination of pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin. This rather non-specific therapy is associated with severe side effects and by far not everyone benefits from treatment. Recently, progress has been made in the development of specifically targeted antiviral therapy for HCV (STAT-C). A major target for such direct acting antivirals (DAAs) is the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or non-structural protein 5B (NS5B), which is essential for viral replication. This review will examine the current state of development of inhibitors targeting the polymerase and issues such as the emergence of antiviral resistance during treatment, as well as strategies to address this problem.\",\"Natural killer (NK) cells constitute a first line of defense against viral infections; their function is governed by the integration of signals from multiple activating and inhibitory surface receptors. We hypothesized that because NKs become rapidly activated by cytokines, response to anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy would be predicted by the phenotype and function of NKs. We used a cohort of 101 patients (55 African, 46 Caucasian-American) who received pegylated-interferon (IFN) and ribavirin for 48 weeks. Multiparameter FACS analysis was used to examine relative expression of 14 different inhibitory/activating receptors. Interleukin (IL)-28B genotyping (rs12979860) was also performed. Pretreatment levels of inhibitory receptors CD158a, CD158b, and CD158e were higher in patients who demonstrated poor viral decline within the first 28 days of therapy. Higher expression levels of inhibitory receptors NKG2A, CD158b, and CD158e were demonstrable in patients who failed to achieve sustained virologic response (SVR). Patients carrying the IL-28B T allele had higher NKG2A expression on effector NKs. We created a mathematical regression model incorporating race, viral level, and two inhibitory receptors. The area-under-the curve was 0.88, which is highly predictive of SVR. Moreover, the model performed complementarily with IL-28B across the CC, CT, and TT genotypes. Purified NKG2A(neg) NKs treated with pegylated-IFN-\\u03b1 for 4 hours demonstrated higher levels of IFN-\\u03b3-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) compared with their NKG2A(pos) counterparts.\",\"Hepatic complications currently represent one of the leading reasons for medical consultations, hospitalisation, and death in the HIV-infected population. This is due to a large extent to viral hepatitis, given its disproportionate frequency in this population. Chronic hepatitis B affects 5-10% of the HIV-infected population. Vaccination has reduced the incidence of liver disease related to hepatitis-B virus (HBV), and the availability of tenofovir has dramatically improved the prognosis of HIV/HBV carriers. Delta hepatitis affects around 15% of HIV-infected individuals in Europe harbouring positive HBsAg. It has the worst prognosis, given its accelerated course to cirrhosis and the absence of successful therapy. Lastly, chronic hepatitis C is the major cause of liver disease in the HIV population. Although classically linked to persons infected parenterally (i.e., intravenous drug users), outbreaks of acute hepatitis C among homosexual men have been reported over the last decade. Treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin provides a cure in less than 40% of patients. However, the introduction of new direct acting antivirals against hepatitis- C virus (HCV) (telaprevir, boceprevir) has revolutionised the field, as HAART did in 1996 in the HIV field, improving the prognosis of co-infected patients. However, interactions between these drugs and antiretroviral agents and the risk of selective resistance pose huge threats in this population.\",\"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) invariably shows wide heterogeneity in infected patients, referred to as a quasispecies population. Massive amounts of genetic information due to the abundance of HCV variants could be an obstacle to evaluate the viral genetic heterogeneity in detail.\",\"Most viral diseases, with the exception of those caused by human immunodeficiency virus, are self-limited illnesses that do not require specific antiviral therapy. The currently available antiviral drugs target 3 main groups of viruses: herpes, hepatitis, and influenza viruses. With the exception of the antisense molecule fomivirsen, all antiherpes drugs inhibit viral replication by serving as competitive substrates for viral DNA polymerase. Drugs for the treatment of influenza inhibit the ion channel M(2) protein or the enzyme neuraminidase. Combination therapy with Interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin remains the backbone treatment for chronic hepatitis C; the addition of serine protease inhibitors improves the treatment outcome of patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1. Chronic hepatitis B can be treated with interferon or a combination of nucleos(t)ide analogues. Notably, almost all the nucleos(t) ide analogues for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B possess anti-human immunodeficiency virus properties, and they inhibit replication of hepatitis B virus by serving as competitive substrates for its DNA polymerase. Some antiviral drugs possess multiple potential clinical applications, such as ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus and cidofovir for the treatment of cytomegalovirus and other DNA viruses. Drug resistance is an emerging threat to the clinical utility of antiviral drugs. The major mechanisms for drug resistance are mutations in the viral DNA polymerase gene or in genes that encode for the viral kinases required for the activation of certain drugs such as acyclovir and ganciclovir. Widespread antiviral resistance has limited the clinical utility of M(2) inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of influenza infections. This article provides an overview of clinically available antiviral drugs for the primary care physician, with a special focus on pharmacology, clinical uses, and adverse effects.\",\"Polymorphisms in the region of the interleukin (IL)28B gene have been associated with pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin treatment response mainly in genotype 1 HCV infections. However, there are few data on HCV genotype 4 (HCV-4) infection. We evaluated, in a unique well-characterized cohort of HCV-4 patients, the association of IL28B polymorphism with response to treatment or liver disease severity.\",\"Hepatic steatosis is one of the factors limiting the virological response to interferon-based antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CH-C) patients infected with genotype 1, while contradictory results have been reported for genotype 2. We aimed to clarify the effect of hepatic steatosis on therapeutic outcome and cumulative positivity of serum HCV RNA in CH-C patients infected with genotype 2 treated by peginterferon (PEG-IFN)\\u03b12b and ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects millions of people worldwide; however, standard therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin has resulted in suboptimal responses. Thus, new anti-HCV drugs with novel mechanisms of action are being studied. In particular, new drugs are being developed that target the NS3/4A protease complex. We evaluated the literature on telaprevir, a new, oral, covalent, reversible NS3/4A HCV protease inhibitor. A MEDLINE search (January 1996-July 2011) was performed to identify relevant clinical trials, and abstracts from hepatology and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) conferences were reviewed. In large clinical trials, the addition of telaprevir to peginterferon and ribavirin resulted in high sustained virologic response rates in both treatment-na\\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Clinical data with telaprevir in the HIV-HCV coinfected population are emerging, as well as data on potential drug-drug interactions with this agent. Preliminary data describe the resistance profile of telaprevir; however, more information is needed in this evolving area. Telaprevir's most common adverse events included rash, pruritis, and anemia. Based on available data, this new anti-HCV drug will likely be widely used and may revolutionize the treatment of HCV-infected individuals.\",\"Insulin resistance, HIV, antiviral drugs and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection contribute to a complex interaction involving the metabolic syndrome. The objective of this review was to explore the meaning of insulin resistance in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients and how it may impact on sustained virological response (SVR) and disease progression.\",\"Telaprevir and boceprevir are highly selective hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A proteaseinhibitors in phase 3 development. Viral breakthrough during mono- and triple-therapies with PEG-interferon and ribavirin and relapse is associated with resistance.\",\"Lethal mutagenesis or virus transition into error catastrophe is an antiviral strategy that aims at extinguishing a virus by increasing the viral mutation rates during replication. The molecular basis of lethal mutagenesis is largely unknown. Previous studies showed that a critical substitution in the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) polymerase was sufficient to allow the virus to escape extinction through modulation of the transition types induced by the purine nucleoside analogue ribavirin. This substitution was not detected in mutant spectra of FMDV populations that had not replicated in the presence of ribavirin, using standard molecular cloning and nucleotide sequencing. Here we selectively amplify and analyze low-melting-temperature cDNA duplexes copied from FMDV genome populations passaged in the absence or presence of ribovirin Hypermutated genomes with high frequencies of A and U were present in both ribavirin -treated and untreated populations, but the major effect of ribavirin mutagenesis was to accelerate the occurrence of AU-rich mutant clouds during the early replication rounds of the virus. The standard FMDV quasispecies passaged in the absence of ribavirin included the salient transition-modulating, ribavirin resistance mutation, whose frequency increased in populations treated with ribavirin. Thus, even nonmutagenized FMDV quasispecies include a deep, mutationally biased portion of sequence space, in support of the view that the virus replicates close to the error threshold for maintenance of genetic information.\",\"Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can induce insulin resistance (IR) in a genotype-dependent manner and contributes to steatosis, progression of fibrosis and resistance to interferon plus ribavirin therapy. Our understanding of HCV-induced IR has improved considerably over the years, but certain aspects concerning its evaluation still remain elusive to clinical researchers. One of the most important issues is elucidating the ideal method for assessment of IR in the setting of hepatitis C. The hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp is the gold standard method for determining insulin sensitivity, but is impractical as it is labour intensive and time-consuming. To date, all human studies except for four where IR was evaluated in the HCV setting, an estimation of IR has been used rather than direct measurements of insulin-mediated glucose uptake. The most commonly used estimation in the HCV population is the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) which is calculated from a single measurement of fasting insulin and glucose. In this article, we review the use and reporting of HOMA in the literature and provide guidance on its appropriate as well as inappropriate use in the hepatitis setting.\",\"Minority drug-resistant hepatitis C virus (HCV) variants may go undetected yet be clinically important. NS3/4A protease resistance substitutions V36A and A156S/T/V were selected in patients treated with protease inhibitors. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these substitutions pre-existed in HCV infected patients. An allele-specific PCR protocol that detected the NS3/4A protease resistance substitutions V36A and A156S/T/V was used to determine the prevalence of naturally occurring variants in 45 patients. All patient samples were infected with HCV of genotype 1b and were na\\u00efve for pegIFN\\u03b1/ribavirin treatment. Thirty samples (67%) had at least one HCV PI-resistant variant. A156T (23, 51%) was detected more frequently than A156V (13, 29%) or A156S (1, 2%). V36A was detected in 12 samples (27%). These results demonstrate the high prevalence of minority drug-resistant NS3/4 protease resistance substitutions. Our results also demonstrate that allele-specific PCR can be used to detect minor HCV NS3 protease resistant variants in pretreatment samples and to study in detail the evolution of mutant viruses during targeted antiviral therapy.\",\"The continuous emergence of drug-resistant viruses is a major obstacle for the successful treatment of viral infections, thus representing a persistent spur to the search for new therapeutic strategies. Among them, multidrug treatments are currently at the forefront of pharmaceutical, clinical, and computational investigation. Still, there are many unknowns in the way that different drugs interact among themselves and with the pathogen that they aim to control. Inspired by experimental studies with picornavirus, here, we discuss the performance of sequential vs. combination therapies involving two dissimilar drugs: the mutagen ribavirin and an inhibitor of viral replication, guanidine. Because a systematic analysis of viral response to drug doses demands a precious amount of time and resources, we present and analyze an in silico model describing the dynamics of the viral population under the action of the two drugs. The model predicts the response of the viral population to any dose combination, the optimal therapy to be used in each case, and the way to minimize the probability of appearance of resistant mutants. In agreement with the theoretical predictions, in vitro experiments with foot-and-mouth disease virus confirm that the suitability of simultaneous or sequential administration depends on the drug doses. In addition, intrinsic replicative characteristics of the virus (e.g., replication through RNA only or a DNA intermediate) play a key role to determine the appropriateness of a sequential or combination therapy. Knowledge of several model parameters can be derived by means of few, simple experiments, such that the model and its predictions can be extended to other viral systems.\",\"Natural killer (NK) cells exhibit a polarized phenotype with increased cytotoxicity and decreased interferon gamma (IFN-\\u03b3) production in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Here, we asked whether this is caused by type I interferon (IFN)-induced expression and phosphorylation levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) molecules in NK cells and whether it affects the response and refractoriness of NK cells to IFN-\\u03b1-based therapy of HCV. STAT1 levels in NK cells were significantly higher in patients with chronic HCV infection than in uninfected controls. STAT1 levels and induction of phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) increased further during IFN-\\u03b1-based therapy with preferential STAT1 over STAT4 phosphorylation. Induction of pSTAT1 correlated with increased NK cytotoxicity (tumor necrosis factor-apoptosis-inducing ligand [TRAIL] expression and degranulation) and decreased IFN-\\u03b3 production. NK cells from patients with a greater than 2 log(10) first-phase HCV RNA decline to IFN-\\u03b1-based therapy (>99% IFN effectiveness) displayed strong pSTAT1 induction in vivo and were refractory to further stimulation in vitro. In contrast, NK cells from patients with a less than 2 log(10) first-phase HCV RNA decline exhibited lower pSTAT1 induction in vivo (P = 0.024), but retained greater IFN-\\u03b1 responsiveness in vitro (P = 0.024). NK cells of all patients became refractory to in vivo and in vitro stimulation by IFN-\\u03b1 during the second-phase virological response.\",\"Innate immunity plays an important role in host antiviral response to hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection. Recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL28B and host response to peginterferon \\u03b1 (PEG-IFN\\u03b1) and ribavirin (RBV) were shown to be strongly associated. We aimed to determine the gene expression involving innate immunity in IL28B genotypes and elucidate its relation to response to antiviral treatment. We genotyped IL28B SNPs (rs8099917 and rs12979860) in 88 chronic hepatitis C patients treated with PEG-IFN\\u03b1-2b/RBV and quantified expressions of viral sensors (RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2), adaptor molecule (IPS-1), related ubiquitin E3-ligase (RNF125), modulators (ISG15 and USP18), and IL28 (IFN\\u03bb). Both IL28B SNPs were 100% identical; 54 patients possessed rs8099917 TT/rs12979860 CC (IL28B major patients) and 34 possessed rs8099917 TG/rs12979860 CT (IL28B minor patients). Hepatic expressions of viral sensors and modulators in IL28B minor patients were significantly up-regulated compared with that in IL28B major patients (\\u2248 3.3-fold, P < 0.001). However, expression of IPS-1 was significantly lower in IL28B minor patients (1.2-fold, P = 0.028). Expressions of viral sensors and modulators were significantly higher in nonvirological responders (NVR) than that in others despite stratification by IL28B genotype (\\u2248 2.6-fold, P < 0.001). Multivariate and ROC analyses indicated that higher RIG-I and ISG15 expressions and RIG-I/IPS-1 expression ratio were independent factors for NVR. IPS-1 down-regulation in IL28B minor patients was confirmed by western blotting, and the extent of IPS-1 protein cleavage was associated with the variable treatment response.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection is considered a metabolic disease. It is associated with a specific metabolic syndrome, HCV-associated dysmetabolic syndrome (HCADS), consisting of steatosis, hypocholesterolemia and insulin resistance/diabetes. These metabolic derangements contribute to a decrease in sustained virological response (SVR) to pegylated-interferon-\\u03b1-ribavirin as standard of care (SOC), and are associated with progression of liver fibrosis.\",\"Individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are at risk for cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment of HCV infection has undergone several revisions over the past 15 years and continues to evolve. The current major advance is with the protease inhibitors in addition to pegylated interferon and ribavirin. The emergence of resistance needs to be monitored carefully as newer and more potent drugs are added to the interferon and ribavirin backbone drugs. In addition, adverse events will be more frequent and some novel ones will require special attention.\",\"Given its essential role in the process of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, the viral NS3/4A serine protease is arguably the most thoroughly characterized HCV enzyme and the most intensively pursued anti-HCV target for drug development thus far. Recent data have demonstrated promise for the NS3 protease inhibitor boceprevir, which, when added to the standard of care peginterferon and ribavirin, improves sustained virological response while shortening duration of therapy in genotype-1-infected individuals. This review discusses the mechanism of action of boceprevir, its effects on HCV, and its viral resistance.\",\"The approval of the first direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been eagerly expected for treating chronic hepatitis C in HIV individuals given that progression to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease occurs faster in the co-infected population. The appropriate and judicious use of DAAs may provide cure to a large number of HIV-HCV patients. On the contrary, the widespread use of DAAs will occasionally be off-label or under unsatisfactory medical conditions, which may result in undesirable toxicities, drug interactions or selection of drug resistance in HCV. As a result of using first-generation DAAs in HIV-HCV-co-infected patients, a growing proportion of the remaining hepatitis C individuals will be those harboring non-HCV 1 genotypes or drug-resistant HCV variants. Over time, the largest reservoir of HCV genotype 1 patients will accumulate in resource-poor nations where access to hepatitis C therapy has been elusive and HIV treatment remains the primary health issue for the co-infected population.\",\"Given the side effects associated with intravenous injections of interferon, an interferon-free regimen for the treatment of HCV infections is highly desirable. Recently published clinical studies show that interferon-free combination therapies containing ribavirin are efficacious, suggesting that an interferon-free therapy could be adopted in the near future. Therefore, understanding HCV resistance to ribavirin could be of major importance. In an approach to understand the effect of ribavirin on HCV replication and HCV resistance, we have selected a ribavirin resistant mutant of HCV in vitro.\",\"To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of boceprevir, a novel oral hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural 3 (NS3) protease inhibitor for the treatment of chronic HCV infection, specifically, genotype 1.\",\"The treatment of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) by a combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin, according to early viral kinetics, leads to a sustained virological response (SVR) in more than 50% of patients with chronic infection. This SVR is a complete recovery of the infection but more than 50% of genotype 1-infected patients do not achieve SVR. A better understanding of the viral cycle, and the characterization of viral enzymes which are potential targets, resulted in the development of new molecules, direct acting antivirals (DAA) targeted against HCV, either specific of genotype 1 (protease inhibitors NS3/NS4A and polymerase inhibitors NS5B) or with a wider spectrum (NS5A or entry inhibitors), and non-specific antivirals (new interferons, cyclophilin inhibitors). We describe the results of phase II and III trials which clearly demonstrated a 20 to 30% increase in the SVR rate of genotype 1-infected patients, either na\\u00efve or treatment experienced. These new drugs should be approved by the end of 2011, after a temporary approval for compassionate use in cirrhotic patients with previous relapse or partial response to the combination therapy. In the future, the main limitations of triple therapy will be safety (cutaneous rash or anemia which may be controlled), cost, compliance, viral resistance, and drug interactions that must be avoided by educating patients and physicians.\",\"Treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has substantially evolved over the past decade after the Consensus Conference organized by the European Association for the Study of the Liver in 1999. Since then, the standard of care (SOC) for patients with chronic hepatitis C has been the combination of pegylated interferon (pegIFN) alpha-2a or -2b and ribavirin. In patients infected with HCV genotype 1, by far the most frequent HCV genotype worldwide, such treatment leads to a cure of infection in only 40% to 50% of cases. Several factors have been identified to play a role in the outcome of therapy, including the treatment schedule, disease characteristics, viral, and host factors. Human genetic factors have been identified by a recent landmark discovery. However, these factors only partly explain the ability of IFN and ribavirin therapy to cure HCV infection. Several studies have demonstrated that, in non-responders, interferon-stimulated genes were up-regulated prior to therapy through unclear mechanisms. These findings, together with clinical, biochemical and histological data, may help better identify responders before starting therapy. This becomes particularly important as the standard treatment is physically and economically demanding. The future treatment of patients infected with HCV genotype 1 will be based on the combination of pegIFN and ribavirin with a protease inhibitor, telaprevir or boceprevir. Promising results of this triple combination in phase III clinical trials have been recently reported at the Liver Meeting 2010. With this therapy, higher cure rates will be achieved, but specific issues will be raised, such as the emergence of resistance to the protease inhibitors. The goal of this review is to discuss mechanisms involved in the non-response to current and future standard treatments.\",\"Mutations in the core and NS5A region of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b have been associated with response to interferon (IFN) therapy. Genome-wide association studies have revealed that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of interleukin 28B (IL28B) contributes to IFN response. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the SNP of IL28B (rs8099917) and amino acid substitutions in the core and NS5A region affect the response to IFN therapy.\",\"Pretreatment insulin resistance (IR) is associated with treatment response to peginterferon plus ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) combination therapy in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection. However, the impact of PegIFN/RBV therapy on both IR and \\u03b2-cell function in CHC patients has rarely been investigated.\",\"An association has been reported between genetic polymorphism near IL28B gene and the prevalence of mutation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) core region residue 70, both of which have been associated with a lack of virologic response to antiviral combination therapy with peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin. This study investigated whether PEG-IFN/ribavirin combination therapy induces amino acid (AA) mutation at residue 70 of HCV and whether genetic polymorphism near IL28B gene affects it. AA substitutions at residue 70 of the HCV core region were measured and compared before and after combination therapy in 65 non-responders and 88 relapsers to the combination therapy. In three patients in whom both wild-type AA (arginine) and mutant-type AA (glutamine or histidine) were detected at residue 70 before treatment, only mutant-type AA was identified after treatment. In two patients who had wild-type AA solely before treatment, both wild-type and mutant-type AAs were identified at residue 70 after treatment. In five patients, in whom the AA had changed at residue 70 between before and after treatment, four patients carried the TT genotype at a polymorphic locus (rs8099917) near the IL28B gene and one carried the TG/GG genotype. No difference was found in the prevalence of this change of AA at residue 70 between the TT and the TG/GG genotype. Antiviral combination therapy with PEG-IFN and ribavirin does not appear to induce mutation of HCV core region residue 70 regardless of genetic polymorphism near the IL28B gene in Japanese patients infected with HCV genotype 1b.\",\"Recent studies suggested that SVR rates might be lower in HCV patients with insulin resistance (IR) than in patients without IR, but the extent of the impact of IR on treatment response has not been established. We aimed to confirm the role of IR assessed by the homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) on SVR and to determine its magnitude.\",\"The triglycerides \\u00d7 glucose (TyG) index is a recently proposed surrogate marker of insulin resistance (IR), calculated from fasting plasma triglyceride and glucose concentrations. We tested the host and viral factors associated with Tyg and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) scores, comparing their associations with histological features and with sustained virological response (SVR) in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C(G1CHC). Three hundred and forty consecutive patients with G1CHC were considered. All had a liver biopsy scored by one pathologist for staging and grading (Scheuer), and graded for steatosis, which was considered moderate-severe if \\u226530%. Anthropometric and metabolic measurements, including IR measured by both HOMA and TyG, were registered. By linear regression analysis, TyG was independently associated with waist circumference (WC), total cholesterol, presence of arterial hypertension, Log10 HCV-RNA and steatosis. Similarly, WC and steatosis were significantly associated with HOMA. Older age (OR, 1.036; 95%CI, 1.004-1.070, P = 0.02), higher WC (1.031; 1.004-1.060; P = 0.02) and higher TyG (11.496; 3.163-41.784; P < 0.001) were linked to moderate-to-severe steatosis (\\u226530%) by multiple logistic regression analysis. When TyG was replaced by HOMA-IR in the model, the latter remained significantly associated with steatosis \\u226530% (1.237; 1.058-1.448; P = 0.008). Receiver operating characteristic curves showed a similar performance of TyG (AUC 0.682) and HOMA-IR (AUC 0.699) in predicting moderate-severe steatosis. No independent associations were found between both TyG and HOMA and fibrosis or SVR. In patients with G1CHC , TyG, an easy-to-calculate and low-cost surrogate marker of IR, is linked to liver steatosis and shows an independent association with viral load.\",\"The approval of directly acting antivirals (DAA) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection will represent a major breakthrough for the 180 million persons infected worldwide. Paradoxically, hepatitis C is the only human chronic viral disease that can be cured, as all other pathogenic viruses infecting humans either display self-limited courses or establish non-eradicable persistent infections. Until now, treatment of chronic hepatitis C consisted of the combination of peginterferon-\\u03b1 plus ribavirin, which provided limited rates of cure and was associated with frequent side effects. Several DAA have been identified that inhibit the NS3 protease, the NS5B polymerase or the NS5A replication complex, and have entered the final steps of clinical development. These molecules, coupled with significant progress made in the recognition of more potent and safe interferon forms (e.g. interferon-\\u03bb) and host protein targets (e.g. alisporivir), are opening a new era in hepatitis C therapeutics. The expectations are so great that, to some extent, it is reminiscent of what happened in 1996 in the HIV field when the introduction of the first protease inhibitors as part of triple combinations revolutionized antiretroviral therapy. To maximize treatment success and reduce the likelihood of drug resistance selection, a proper individualization of hepatitis C therapy will be required, choosing the most convenient drugs and strategies according to distinct viral and host profiles. The complexity of HCV therapeutics has reached a point that presumably will lead to the birth of a new specialist, the HCV doctor.\",\"A higher baseline homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score has sometimes predicted a poorer sustained virological response (SVR) rate to peginterferon/ribavirin therapy in treatment-na\\u00efve chronic hepatitis C patients.\",\"HCV infection is a very common cause of chronic viral hepatitis. It is a worldwide health problem with approximately 170 million persons infected and areas of high endemicity in which the percentage of the population infected reaches 30%. It is a progressive disease that can lead to complications such as severe liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, ascites, esophageal varices, gastrointestinal bleeding and, in 30-50% of patients with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma. Extrahepatic pathologies such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis have been associated with HCV infection. Effective treatment exists, and is based on IFN-\\u03b1. Sustained disappearance of the virus (sustained virological response) radically changes the natural history of chronic hepatitis C, with reduced or no disease progression and complications. Interferon-based treatment has improved over the years owing to the association with ribavirin and subsequently with 'pegylation' of interferon molecules. The present standard of care results in a response rate of up to 80% in some subpopulations. Nevertheless, some patients do not respond to this therapy. Several factors predicting nonresponse to interferon therapy have been investigated since it became available. These factors include the characteristics of the virus and of the subject infected, and the therapy used. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of these factors, and insights into the newly recognized causes of nonresponse to help clinicians select the most appropriate therapy for HCV viral hepatitis.\",\"It has been reported that genetic polymorphisms near the IL28B gene or amino acid substitutions in hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein are associated with the clinical outcome of peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin combination therapy. The impact of these factors on the pure sensitivity/resistance to interferon was evaluated. Changes in the HCV RNA levels 24, 48, 72, and 120 hr after administering a single dose of standard interferon (IFN) were measured in 156 HCV-infected patients. The changes were compared based on the genetic polymorphisms near the IL28B gene or amino acid substitutions in the HCV core region. Among patients with HCV genotype 1b, there were differences in the reduction and subsequent increase in HCV RNA levels after administering IFN based on rs8099917 genetic polymorphisms. Amino acid substitutions at residue 70 were associated with differences in the changes in HCV RNA levels only in patients with TG/GG genotype. Multivariate analyses showed that genetic polymorphisms near the IL28B gene was the sole independent factor that was associated with the reduction in HCV RNA levels after administering IFN and the final response to the combination therapy. Among patients infected with HCV genotype 2a or 2b, there were no differences in the changes in HCV RNA levels based on the genetic polymorphisms near the IL28B gene. In HCV genotype 1b, genetic variations near the IL28B gene affected the sensitivity/resistance to IFN strongly. Genetic polymorphisms near the IL28B gene did not affect the sensitivity/resistance to IFN in HCV genotype 2.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the major etiology and the reason of chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular cancer and liver transplantation. Less than half of patients with HCV-related chronic hepatitis achieve sustained viral clearance with current pegylated interferon and ribavirin (P+R) combination therapy. Due to the insufficient treatment success, an extended search for new, direct acting anti-HCV agents (DAAs) is ongoing, already leading to submissions of applications for marketing authorization of the protease-inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir. Both are effective only in triple combinations with P+R. Studies demonstrate a 50% success rate advantage for triple therapies above current standards. In addition, treatment duration can be shortened, and half of the patients who failed previous therapy with P+R can be cured with triple therapies. A major concern with new DAAs is rapid development of DAA-resistant viral mutants, a reason as well as a consequence of insufficient triple therapy. Clinical studies with boceprevir and telaprevir are reviewed in this paper.\",\"To review the use of telaprevir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.\",\"Anemia is commonly observed as a side effect in a treatment with protease inhibitors combined with peginterferon alpha and ribavirin for hepatitis C virus infection. This study assessed the safety, tolerability, viral kinetics, and selection of variants in telaprevir monotherapy for 24 weeks, and outcomes of the off-study treatment with peginterferon alpha-2b and ribavirin among Japanese female patients at a median age of 54 years who were difficult to treat with the standard therapy (peginterferon alpha-2b and ribavirin) alone in Japan.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major cause of liver disease throughout the world, is difficult to treat with interferon (IFN) (and various formulations and combinations thereof) being the only approved molecule available. It has been investigated recently that proinflammatory chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) induced by HCV partially inhibits the antiviral IFN-\\u03b1 therapy. Therefore, the current study was aimed to prospectively utilize the baseline IL-8 levels in the HCV infected serum and predicts its role in sustained virological response (SVR) to IFN-\\u03b1+ribavirin therapy, in chronic HCV patients in Pakistan. One hundred and ten hepatitis C patients without any other infections underwent IFN-\\u03b1+ribavirin combination treatment. Baseline IL-8 levels were determined before starting of the therapy for all these patients. Fifteen normal volunteers negative for HCV were kept as control. The baseline IL-8 levels were found significantly higher in all HCV positive patients as compared to normal healthy volunteers (1083.54 \\u00b1 85.72 pg/ml versus 6.99 \\u00b1 1.05 pg/ml [mean \\u00b1 SEM], p<0.01) and were also significantly higher in non-responders than responders (p<0.05). Comparatively higher mean baseline IL-8 levels were observed in non-responders (2442.02 \\u00b1 159.92 pg/ml), than late (1009.31 \\u00b1 45.31) and rapid (540.91 \\u00b1 27.06 pg/ml) responders. Significant relation was observed between baseline IL-8 level and response to IFN therapy (p<0.01). Results of this study suggest that increased levels of IL-8 in HCV infection might be involved in pathogenesis, persistence and resistance to IFN-\\u03b1+ribavirin combination therapy.\",\"Many individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) develop a chronic infection, and of those who are treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (RBV), many do not respond. While the nucleoside analog RBV improves treatment outcome, and will likely be an important component of therapy with next-generation viral inhibitors, RBV's mechanism is controversial. Most of RBV's proposed mechanisms require RBV import into cells. Therefore, we explored whether host-based RBV resistance develops through reduced cellular uptake, akin to chemotherapy resistance in some cancers. We examined the effect of host-based RBV resistance on HCV replication in cultured hepatoma Huh7.5 liver cells and whether RBV resistance develops in HCV patients. When Huh7.5 cells were exposed to RBV, resistance developed through reduced RBV uptake via the ENT1 nucleoside transporter and antiviral efficacy was reduced. The uptake defect in RBV-resistant cells was specific to RBV, since transport of another ENT1 substrate, cytidine, was unaffected. Importantly, RBV uptake significantly declined in HCV patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following 4 weeks of therapy. Furthermore, maintenance of RBV uptake correlated with rapid treatment response. Our results uncovered a novel form of antiviral drug resistance and suggest that host-based RBV resistance develops in HCV patients undergoing therapy and that maintenance of RBV uptake may contribute to rapid viral clearance.\",\"Insulin resistance (IR) is common in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and associates with reduced virological response to pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin therapy, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. We have previously shown that, in CHC patients, insulin plasma levels are inversely related to antiviral effect induced by PEG-IFN. Therefore, we investigated the in vitro effect of insulin on interferon alpha (IFN-\\u03b1) intracellular signaling as well as that of IFN-\\u03b1 on insulin signaling. HepG2 cells, preincubated with or without insulin, were stimulated with IFN-\\u03b12b and messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were measured at different timepoints. The role of intracellular suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) was evaluated with the small interfering RNA (siRNA) strategy. To assess the effect of IFN-\\u03b1 on insulin signaling, HepG2 were preincubated with or without IFN before addition of insulin and cells were then analyzed for IRS-1 and for Akt/PKB Ser473 phosphorylation. Insulin (100 and 1000 nM) significantly reduced in a dose-dependent fashion IFN-induced gene expression of PKR (P=0.017 and P=0.0017, respectively), MxA (P=0.0103 and P=0.00186), and 2'-5' oligoadenylatesynthetase 1 (OAS-1) (P=0.002 and P=0.006). Insulin also reduced IFN-\\u03b1-induced PKR protein expression. Although insulin was confirmed to increase SOCS3 expression, siRNA SOCS3 did not restore ISG expression after insulin treatment. IFN-\\u03b1 was found to reduce, in a dose-dependent fashion, IRS-1 gene expression as well as Akt/PKB Ser473 phosphorylation induced by insulin.\",\"Several studies recently revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the interleukin28B (IL28B) region are associated with the response to pegylated interferon-alfa (PEG-IFN-alfa) and ribavirin (RBV) treatment among hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected individuals of European, African and Asian ancestry. The purpose of the study was to establish methods for determining the SNP rs8099917 associated with IL28B, which might be useful for further research of the treatment of HCV.\",\"Substitution of amino acids 70 and 91 in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core region is a significant predictor of poor responses to peginterferon-plus-ribavirin therapy, while their molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here we investigated these differences in the response to alpha interferon (IFN) by using HCV cell culture with R70Q, R70H, and L91M substitutions. IFN treatment of cells transfected or infected with the wild type or the mutant HCV clones showed that the R70Q, R70H, and L91M core mutants were significantly more resistant than the wild type. Among HCV-transfected cells, intracellular HCV RNA levels were significantly higher for the core mutants than for the wild type, while HCV RNA in culture supernatant was significantly lower for these mutants than for the wild type. IFN-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 and expression of the interferon-inducible genes were significantly lower for the core mutants than for the wild type, suggesting cellular unresponsiveness to IFN. The expression level of an interferon signal attenuator, SOCS3, was significantly higher for the R70Q, R70H, and L91M mutants than for the wild type. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), which upregulates SOCS3, was significantly higher for the R70Q, R70H, and L91M mutants than for the wild type, suggesting interferon resistance, possibly through IL-6-induced, SOCS3-mediated suppression of interferon signaling. Expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins were significantly higher in cells transfected with a core mutant than in those transfected with the wild type. In conclusion, HCV R70 and L91 core mutants were resistant to interferon in vitro, and the resistance may be induced by IL-6-induced upregulation of SOCS3. Those mechanisms may explain clinical interferon resistance of HCV core mutants.\",\"Protease inhibitors (PIs) have proven to be effective adjuncts to interferon/ribavirin treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Little clinical or in vitro data exists, however, on their effectiveness for nontype 1 genotypes that predominate in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and most of Asia. NS3 protease and NS4A genes from genotypes 1-6 were inserted into the JFH clone to generate replication-competent intergenotype chimeras. Susceptibility to PIs was determined by replication and infectivity assays. To study resistance development, chimeras were cultured in subinhibitory concentrations of PIs and mutations phenotypically characterized. Marked differences in susceptibility of different genotypes to danoprevir (ITMN-191) and telaprevir (VX-950) were observed. Genotypes 1, 4, and 6 showed median inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of 2-3 nM, >100-fold lower than genotypes 2/3/5 (250-750 nM). Telaprevir susceptibilities varied over a 4-fold range, with genotypes 1 and 2 being most susceptible and genotypes 4 and 5 most resistant. Culture of genotypes 1-6 in PIs induced numerous mutations in the NS3 protease domain, highly variable between genotypes. Introduction of danoprevir and BILN 2061-induced mutations into the original clones by site-directed mutagenesis (n = 29) all conferred resistant phenotypes, with particularly large increases (1-2 log greater IC(50) values) in the initially susceptible genotypes 1/4/6. Most introduced mutations and showed little or no effect on replicative fitness.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 3-4A (NS3-4A) is a complex composed of NS3 and its cofactor NS4A. It harbours serine protease as well as NTPase/RNA helicase activities and is essential for viral polyprotein processing, RNA replication and virion formation. Specific inhibitors of the NS3-4A protease significantly improve sustained virological response rates in patients with chronic hepatitis C when combined with pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin. The NS3-4A protease can also target selected cellular proteins, thereby blocking innate immune pathways and modulating growth factor signalling. Hence, NS3-4A is not only an essential component of the viral replication complex and prime target for antiviral intervention but also a key player in the persistence and pathogenesis of HCV. This review provides a concise update on the biochemical and structural aspects of NS3-4A, its role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C and the clinical development of NS3-4A protease inhibitors.\",\"PSI-352938 is a novel cyclic phosphate prodrug of \\u03b2-D-2'-deoxy-2'-\\u03b1-fluoro-2'-\\u03b2-C-methylguanosine 5'-monophosphate that has potent activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV) in vitro. The studies described here characterize the in vitro anti-HCV activity of PSI-352938, alone and in combination with other inhibitors of HCV, and the cross-resistance profile of PSI-352938. The effective concentration required to achieve 50% inhibition for PSI-352938, determined using genotype 1a-, 1b-, and 2a-derived replicons stably expressed in the Lunet cell line, were 0.20, 0.13, and 0.14 \\u03bcM, respectively. The active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, PSI-352666, inhibited recombinant NS5B polymerase from genotypes 1 to 4 with comparable 50% inhibitory concentrations. In contrast, PSI-352938 did not inhibit the replication of hepatitis B virus or human immunodeficiency virus in vitro. PSI-352666 did not significantly affect the activity of human DNA and RNA polymerases. PSI-352938 and its cyclic phosphate metabolites did not affect the cyclic GMP-mediated activation of protein kinase G. Clearance studies using replicon cells demonstrated that PSI-352938 cleared cells of HCV replicon RNA and prevented replicon rebound. An additive to synergistic effect was observed when PSI-352938 was combined with other classes of HCV inhibitors, including alpha interferon, ribavirin, NS3/4A inhibitors, an NS5A inhibitor, and nucleoside/nucleotide and nonnucleoside inhibitors. Cross-resistance studies showed that PSI-352938 remained fully active against replicons containing the S282T or the S96T/N142T amino acid alteration. Replicons that contain mutations conferring resistance to various classes of nonnucleoside inhibitors also remained sensitive to inhibition by PSI-352938. PSI-352938 is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical study in genotype 1-infected individuals.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and the identification of the predictors of response to antiviral therapy is an important clinical issue.\",\"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of clinical and epidemiological characteristics of 183 HIV/HCV coinfected patients and HCV clearance after antiviral treatment on serum sFas and sFasL levels. Thirty out of 183 patients underwent HCV antiviral therapy with IFN-\\u03b1 + RBV for a duration of 48 weeks. HCV genotype 1 and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) had a significant positive relationship, and CD4+/\\u03bcL had a significant negative relationship with sFas (R-square = 0.582; p < 0.001) and sFasL (R-square = 0.216; p < 0.001) in multivariate linear regression analysis. HCV genotype 1 was the only significant variable associated with the sFas/sFasL ratio (R-square = 0.201; p < 0.001). sFas and sFasL levels had positive significant correlations with serum sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, and HOMA levels (p < 0.05). Among patients on IFN-\\u03b1 + RBV therapy, 15 patients showed a sustained virologic response (SVR), while 15 patients were non-responders (NR). Patients with SVR had significant decreases in sFas (p = 0.008) and sFas/sFasL ratio (p = 0.002), while non-responders had a significant increase in sFasL values (p = 0.013). In conclusion, HCV genotype 1, high HOMA, and low CD4+/\\u03bcL were associated with high serum levels of sFas and sFasL, which indicate higher levels of inflammation and, possibly, increased cardiovascular risk. Moreover, response to HCV antiviral therapy is known to reduce inflammation.\",\"In patients with chronic hepatitis C who failed to respond to standard therapy, high-dose pegylated interferon (IFN)-\\u03b1 and/or ribavirin could induce a stronger antiviral response and prevent treatment failure and HCV resistance when combined with direct-acting antivirals. The influence of genetic determinants in this context remains unknown.\",\"In the present work, we described the activity of the thiosemicarbazone derived from 5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanone (TSC), which we previously characterized as a new compound that inhibits bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection. We showed that TSC acts at a point of time that coincides with the onset of viral RNA synthesis and that it inhibits the activity of BVDV replication complexes (RCs). Moreover, we have selected five BVDV mutants that turned out to be highly resistant to TSC but still susceptible to ribavirin (RBV). Four of these resistant mutants carried an N264D mutation in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The remaining mutant showed an A392E mutation within the same protein. Some of these mutants replicated slower than the wild-type (wt) virus in the absence of TSC, whereas others showed a partial reversion to the wt phenotype over several passages in the absence of the compound. The docking of TSC in the crystal structure of the BVDV RdRp revealed a close contact between the indane ring of the compound and several residues within the fingers domain of the enzyme, some hydrophobic contacts, and hydrogen bonds with the thiosemicarbazone group. Finally, in the mutated RdRp from resistant BVDV, these interactions with TSC could not be achieved. Interestingly, TSC inhibited BVDV replication in cell culture synergistically with RBV. In conclusion, TSC emerges as a new nonnucleoside inhibitor of BVDV RdRp that is synergistic with RBV, a feature that turns it into a potential compound to be evaluated against hepatitis C virus (HCV).\",\"The role of insulin resistance (IR) and hepatic steatosis in fibrogenesis in chronic hepatitis C infection (CHC) has yielded conflicting data and few studies have been performed in Asian-region populations. We retrospectively investigated the relationship between host metabolic variables, including IR and hepatic steatosis, to hepatic fibrosis in Asian-region CHC genotype 2/3 patients.\",\"Current treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is based on the combination of pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin. The recent development of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) molecules that are active on HCV, together with in vitro and in vivo studies showing that these drugs may lead to the selection of resistant viruses if administered alone, has raised concerns that resistance may undermine therapy based on DAAs. A new standard-of-care treatment will soon be available for both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients infected with HCV genotype 1, based on a triple combination of pegylated interferon-\\u03b1, ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor (either telaprevir or boceprevir). With this therapy, most failures to eradicate infection in treatment-adherent patients are due to an inadequate response to pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin, in the context of a low genetic barrier to resistance of first-generation protease inhibitors. This article reviews patterns of resistance to HCV DAA drugs in development, the mechanisms underlying treatment failure when these drugs are combined with pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 and ribavirin, the consequences of treatment failure, and possible means of optimizing future therapies that use DAAs.\",\"Both host and viral factors have been implicated in influencing the response to pegylated-interferon/ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Among the viral factors, sequence heterogeneity within NS5A and core regions has been proposed. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between virological responses to PEG-IFN/RBV therapy and sequence heterogeneity within NS5A, including the IFN/RBV resistance-determining region (IRRDR), the interferon sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) and the core region. Pretreatment sequences of NS5A and the core regions were analyzed in 57 HCV-1b-infected patients who were to be treated with PEG-IFN/RBV. Of 40 patients infected with HCV having an IRRDR with four or more mutations (IRRDR \\u2265 4), 28 (70%) patients achieved a sustained virological response (SVR). On the other hand, only 4 (24%) of 17 patients infected with HCV having an IRRDR with three or fewer mutations (IRRDR \\u2264 3) achieved a SVR (P = 0.001). Similarly, 22 (71%) of 31 patients infected with HCV and having an ISDR with one or more mutations (ISDR \\u2265 1) achieved a SVR while 10 (38%) of 26 patients infected with HCV and having an ISDR without any mutations (ISDR = 0) achieved a SVR (P = 0.014). As for the core region, there was significant correlation between a single mutation at position 70 (Gln(70)) and non-SVR (P = 0.02). Notably, Gln(70) was more prominently associated with the null response (P = 0.0007). In conclusion, sequence heterogeneity within the IRRDR and ISDR, and a single point mutation at position 70 of the core region of HCV-1b are likely to be correlated with virological responses to PEG-IFN/RBV therapy.\",\"INX-08189 is an aryl-phosphoramidate of 6-O-methyl-2'-C-methyl guanosine. INX-08189 was highly potent in replicon assays, with a 50% effective concentration of 10\\u00b16 nM against hepatitis C genotype 1b at 72 h. The inhibitory effect on viral replication was rapid, with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 35\\u00b18 nM at 24 h. An intracellular 2'-C-methyl guanosine triphosphate (2'-C-MeGTP) concentration of 2.43\\u00b10.42 pmol/10(6) cells was sufficient to achieve 90% inhibition of viral replication. In vitro resistance studies confirmed that the S282T mutation in the NS5b gene conferred an approximately 10-fold reduction in sensitivity to INX-08189. However, the complete inhibition of S282T mutant replicons still could be achieved with an EC90 of 344\\u00b1170 nM. Drug combination studies of INX-08189 and ribavirin indicated significant synergy in antiviral potency both in wild-type and S282T-expressing replicons. Genotype 1b replicons could be cleared after 14 days of culture when exposed to as little as 20 nM INX-08189. No evidence of mitochondrial toxicity was observed after 14 days of INX-08189 exposure in both HepG2 and CEM human cell lines. In vivo studies of rats and cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated that 2'-C-MeGTP concentrations in liver equivalent to the EC90 could be attained after a single oral dose of INX-08189. Rat liver 2'-C-MeGTP concentrations were proportional to dose, sustained for greater than 24 h, and correlated with plasma concentrations of the nucleoside metabolite 2'-C-methyl guanosine. The characteristics displayed by INX-08189 support its continued development as a clinical candidate for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.\",\"Danoprevir (RG7227; ITMN-191) is a potent inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A serine protease. The aims of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose phase Ib study were to evaluate safety, tolerability, antiviral activity, resistance, and pharmacokinetics of once- and twice-daily danoprevir in the presence of low-dose ritonavir (danoprevir/r) and in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD)/ribavirin in treatment-naive HCV genotype 1 patients.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of liver disease worldwide. HCV infection is currently treated with IFN\\u03b1 plus ribavirin for 24 to 48 weeks. This demanding therapy fails in up to 50% of patients, so the use of pharmacogenetic biomarkers to predict the outcome of treatment would reduce futile treatment of non-responders and help identify patients in whom therapy would be justified. Both IFN\\u03b1 and ribavirin primarily act by modulating the immune system of the patient, and HCV uses multiple mechanisms to counteract the antiviral effects stimulated by therapy. Therefore, response to therapy is influenced by variations in human genes governing the immune system and by differences in HCV genes that blunt antiviral immune responses. This article summarizes recent advances in understanding how host and viral genetic variation affect outcome of therapy. The most notable human associations are polymorphisms within the IL28B gene, but variations in human leukocyte antigen and cytokine genes have also been associated with treatment outcome. The most prominent viral genetic association with outcome of therapy is that HCV genotype 1 is much less sensitive to treatment than genotypes 2 and 3, but genetic differences below the genotype level also influence outcome of therapy, presumably by modulating the ability of viral genes to blunt antiviral immune responses. Pharmacogenetic prediction of the outcome of IFN-based therapy for HCV will require integrating the efficacies of the immunosuppressive mechanisms of a viral isolate, and then interpreting the viral resistance potential in context of the genetic profile of the patient at loci associated with outcome of therapy. Direct-acting inhibitors of HCV that will be used in combination with IFN\\u03b1 are nearing approval, so genetic prediction for anti-HCV therapy will soon need to incorporate viral genetic markers of viral resistance to the new drugs.\",\"Genotypes 2 and 3 (G2/G3) of hepatitis C virus have been lumped together as 'easy to treat'. As a result, guidelines recommend 24 weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin for both. However, a closer look at trials shows that these genotypes are not the same, with G2 infection proving more responsive to peginterferon. The data supporting this conclusion are presented along with possible explanations for the differences observed. Ultimately, decisions must be made about therapy. Rapid virological response (RVR) may be the best parameter predicting successful antiviral therapy. For patients with G2 infection who achieve an RVR, shortened courses of therapy are effective. In contrast, for G3 patients without an RVR, there may be benefit to extending therapy to 48 weeks; however, this requires confirmation in prospective studies. Using RVR to guide therapy may level the playing field between these 'easy to treat' genotypes.\",\"Hepatitis C is a major health problem affecting more than 200 million individuals in world including Pakistan. Current treatment regimen consisting of interferon alpha and ribavirin does not always succeed to eliminate virus completely from the patient's body.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C patients with coexisting heart disease are often denied antiviral treatment due to safety concerns. However, this is not evidence-based.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV genome) polymorphisms are thought to influence the outcome of pegylated-interferon/ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) therapy. This study aimed to examine non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) polymorphisms, e.g. IFN/RBV resistance-determining region (IRRDR) and IFN sensitivity-determining region (ISDR), and core protein polymorphism as predictive therapeutic markers.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a RNA virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae, has been considered to be a significant risk factor in HCV induced liver diseases and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Current combination treatment of pegylated interferon-\\u03b1 (PEG-IFN-\\u03b1) and ribavirin has shown limited efficiency, poor tolerability and significant expense mainly depending upon the HCV genotype. HCV has been divided into six genotypes and 52 subtypes present all over the world. The genetic diversity is more than 30% in different genotypes and 20% in subtypes. It has been suggested that different genotypes do vary in their infectivity and pathogenicity due to the variations in amino acid sequence, thereby influencing the rate of disease progression, severity to cirrhosis and the risk of HCC. HCV Core protein has multifunctional activities in regulation of cells growth and host genes expression essential for infectivity including apoptosis, HCV associated steatosis, immune cell functions, cell transformation, signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. Recent studies have shown variable responses for IFN-ribavirin combination therapy, steatosis, insulin resistance and HCC due to amino acid substitutions in HCV Core region of different genotypes. In the present review, we emphasize on the pathogenicity cause by HCV Core and effect of amino acid sequence variation in disease progression and HCV life cycle.\",\"Polymorphisms of the IL28B gene are highly associated with sustained virological response (SVR) in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with peginterferon and ribavirin. Quantitation of interferon-\\u03b3-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) may also differentiate antiviral response. We evaluated IP-10 levels in pretreatment serum from 115 nonresponders and 157 sustained responders in the Study of Viral Resistance to Antiviral Therapy of Chronic Hepatitis C cohort, including African American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) patients. Mean IP-10 was lower in sustained responders compared with nonresponders (437 \\u00b1 31 vs 704 \\u00b1 44 pg/mL, P < 0.001), both in AA and CA patients. The positive predictive value of low IP-10 levels (<600 pg/mL) for SVR was 69%, whereas the negative predictive value of high IP-10 levels (>600 pg/mL) was 67%. We assessed the combination of pretreatment IP-10 levels with IL28B genotype as predictors of treatment response. The IL28B polymorphism rs12979860 was tested in 210 participants. The CC, CT, and TT genotypes were found in 30%, 49%, and 21% of patients, respectively, with corresponding SVR rates of 87%, 50%, and 39% (P < 0.0001). Serum IP-10 levels within the IL28B genotype groups provided additional information regarding the likelihood of SVR (P < 0.0001). CT carriers with low IP-10 had 64% SVR versus 24% with high IP-10. Similarly, a higher SVR rate was identified for TT and CC carriers with low versus high IP-10 (TT, 48% versus 20%; CC, 89% versus 79%). IL28B genotype and baseline IP-10 levels were additive but independent when predicting SVR in both AA and CA patients.\",\"Genotype-specific sensitivity of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) to interferon-ribavirin (IFN-RBV) combination therapy and reduced HCV response to IFN-RBV as infection progresses from acute to chronic infection suggest that HCV genetic factors and intrahost HCV evolution play important roles in therapy outcomes. HCV polyprotein sequences (n = 40) from 10 patients with unsustainable response (UR) (breakthrough and relapse) and 10 patients with no response (NR) following therapy were identified through the Virahep-C study. Bayesian networks (BNs) were constructed to relate interrelationships among HCV polymorphic sites to UR/NR outcomes. All models showed an extensive interdependence of HCV sites and strong connections (P \\u2264 0.003) to therapy response. Although all HCV proteins contributed to the networks, the topological properties of sites differed among proteins. E2 and NS5A together contributed \\u223c40% of all sites and \\u223c62% of all links to the polyprotein BN. The NS5A BN and E2 BN predicted UR/NR outcomes with 85% and 97.5% accuracy, respectively, in 10-fold cross-validation experiments. The NS5A model constructed using physicochemical properties of only five sites was shown to predict the UR/NR outcomes with 83.3% accuracy for 6 UR and 12 NR cases of the HALT-C study. Thus, HCV adaptation to IFN-RBV is a complex trait encoded in the interrelationships among many sites along the entire HCV polyprotein. E2 and NS5A generate broad epistatic connectivity across the HCV polyprotein and essentially shape intrahost HCV evolution toward the IFN-RBV resistance. Both proteins can be used to accurately predict the outcomes of IFN-RBV therapy.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C is one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease, with approximately 170 million people infected worldwide. The severity of disease varies from asymptomatic chronic infection to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sustained virological response (SVR) is long lasting, associated with a reduced risk of cirrhosis and HCC. In the near future, standard of care (SOC) treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) will include the addition of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) with a protease inhibitor to the pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV). In HCV genotype 1 patients, promising results have been reported when the protease inhibitor telaprevir or boceprevir is added to the SOC, increasing SVR rates from less than 50% (PEG-IFN plus RBV) to 70% (in patients treated with a triple combination of PEG-IFN, RBV plus a protease inhibitor). The future management of patients with these new molecules will require good clinical practice, knowledge of indications, prediction of side effects and monitoring for antiviral resistance. Certain major medical needs are still unmet, requiring studies in special populations (human immunodeficiency virus-HCV-coinfected patients, transplanted patients, etc.) in genotype non-1 patients and in absolute non-responders. Combinations of antivirals with additive potency that lack cross resistance and with a good safety profile may provide new regimens in the future to make HCV the first chronic viral infection eradicated worldwide with a finite duration of combination DAA therapy without IFN. There is ongoing development of new molecules such as HCV enzyme inhibitors. The aim of this review is to summarize the results obtained with DAAs: protease and polymerase inhibitors.\",\"An estimated million people have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. With current treatment success rates, by 2030, more than 40% will be cirrhotic and the number of cases with end-stage liver disease is projected to treble. Current standard-of-care is the combination of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin for 24-48 weeks. Unfortunately this is associated with poor efficacy (45% in HCV GT1; 75% in GT2 and 65% in GT 3) and tolerability. Many patients are either unsuitable for or decline current treatment infection because of the significant side-effects associated with this treatment, including those with decompensated cirrhosis or sever psychiatric illness. It is hoped that the development of direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) will address this huge unmet medical need. The addition of a protease inhibitor to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin is associated with increase in efficacy and shortened duration of therapy in patients with HCV GT1 and is likely to become the new standard-of-care. However, triple therapy will not be suitable for patients with non-1 HCV infection, or contraindications to interferon. It is hoped that the combination of multiple DAAs which target different steps of HCV replication should provide interferon-free treatment regimen. Current and planned studies will determine which combination (protease, nonnucleoside polymerase, nucleoside polymerase, NS5A, cyclophyllin B inhibitors), how many DAAs and duration of therapy will be required to optimise cure. It will also be important to minimise the emergence of multi-resistance, which would jeopardise future retreatment options.\",\"The ability to achieve a sustained virological response (SVR) to peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) depends on numerous host and virological factors, as well as adherence to a prescribed treatment regimen. Patients who have failed to achieve a SVR to PEG-IFN and RBV have limited options for retreatment. Emerging data from phase II and phase III clinical trials of direct-acting antiviral agents suggest that new therapeutic regimens will be available for many patients. Treatment with protease inhibitors such as PEG-IFN, RBV, ribavirin. and boceprevir, combined with PEG-IFN and RBV, has been shown to produce high rates of virological response in both prior relapsers and, to a lesser extent, prior non-responders. The benefits of these novel treatment regimens for each individual patient must be weighed against the side effects, costs and potential of developing viral resistance. Regulatory approval of telaprevir and boceprevir is expected to begin in mid-late 2011.\",\"With the introduction of direct-acting oral antiviral agents we are on the verge of a new era that will transform the treatment landscape. This review discusses recent developments in drug discovery for hepatitis C protease inhibitors. First generation protease inhibitors will offer higher sustained viral response rates in na\\u00efve populations when combined with standard pegylated interferon and ribavirin. However, these dramatic gains will be partially offset by new challenges in viral resistance and increased adverse events.\",\"Hepatitis C is a common cause of chronic viral infection of the liver. It is associated with insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is also associated with the development of hepatic steatosis. The presence of hepatic steatosis is associated with an increased risk of having hepatic fibrosis. This is also associated with the severity of insulin resistance. These findings are specifically germane for those with genotype1 infection. Genotype 3 infection independently causes steatosis and successful treatment of the virus is followed by resolution of steatosis. In genotype 1 infection, the presence of hepatic steatosis is also a risk factor for failure to respond to pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy. Unfortunately efforts to treat insulin resistance prior to antiviral therapy have not been very successful. Newer efforts focused on the role of specific micro RNAs in mediating the metabolic effects of hepatitis C virus infection may provide to ameliorate the metabolic risks of HCV infection.\",\"Approximately 180 million individuals are chronically infected with hepatitis C, which is strongly associated with the development of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Several virological tools (anti-HCV antibody assays, measurement of HCV-RNA, HCV-genotyping) are useful in management of hepatitis C infected patients. The primary goal of antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis C is a sustained virological response (SVR). The HCV genotype should be determined in every patient considered for antiviral therapy because the currently recommended treatment duration and ribavirin doses differ among HCV genotypes. Exact subtyping might gain increased importance for future therapies with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) because of differences of antiviral activities and barriers to resistance among HCV subtypes. Monitoring HCV RNA by a highly sensitive assay (LOD \\u2264 15 IU/ml) is the basis for management of response guided therapy of chronic hepatitis C with pegylated IFN plus ribavirin. Rules for early discontinuation of antiviral therapy in non-responders and determination of optimal treatment durations in virologic responders have been developed for application of individualized treatment strategies.\",\"Hepatic steatosis is commonly seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and the prevalence is much higher prevalence than in the general population or in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Hepatic steatosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C can be due to alcohol consumption and host metabolic factors such as high body mass index (BMI), obesity, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus in which insulin resistance plays an important role. However, in genotype 3 HCV infection, hepatic steatosis can result from direct viral cytopathic effect. Demographic and clinical characteristics associated with hepatic steatosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C including older age, higher BMI, more genotype 3 infection, and higher mean serum levels of triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase and \\u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase. The clinical relevance of hepatic steatosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C includes a close correlation with hepatic fibrosis, and a poor response to combination peginterferon and ribavirin treatment. In addition, hepatic steatosis has been reported to associate with increased frequency of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic HCV infection. Whether life style modification such as weight reduction or adding an insulin resistance reducing agent such as metformin or thiazolidinediones combined with current standard peginterferon plus ribavirin treatment will benefit to the chronic hepatitis C patients with hepatic steatosis deserves further evaluation.\",\"As an RNA virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) shows a characteristically high level of nucleotide diversity. Accumulation of nucleotide substitutions in the virus has resulted in diversification into quasispecies, subtypes and distinct genotypes. Pathobiological studies linking nucleotide and amino acid sequences with clinical findings have identified relationships between certain genotypes and characteristic biological properties. Genotype 3 HCV infection was found to be associated with a high level of liver steatosis. Genotypes 1 and 4 were found to be more resistant to interferon (IFN) based therapies than genotypes 2 and 3. Studies of genotype 1 sequences obtained from patients treated with IFN have identified a relationship between favorable response to interferon therapy and amino acid substitutions in the NS5A region (interferon response determining region; ISDR). Further studies have identified a relationship between the effect of IFN therapy and other regions of the NS5A protein. More recently, a relationship has been found between poor response to peg-IFN plus ribavirin combination therapy and substitutions at amino acid 70 and 91 in the core protein. Furthermore, a correlation between human genetic variation in the IL28B (IFN-lamda 3) locus and core amino acid substitutions has been characterized. In this review we briefly summarize the discovery, classification and nomenclature of HCV genotypes and subtypes. We also discuss amino acid substitutions within specific regions that have been reported to be associated with outcome of IFN and peg-IFN plus ribavirin combination therapy.\",\"Response to interferon therapy and disease progression in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients differs among individuals, suggesting a possibility of a contribution of host genetic factors. 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), an important component of the innate immune system with a proven antiviral function, may therefore have a relationship with the response to interferon therapy and clinical course of HCV disease. Our aim was to determine the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at exon 7 splice acceptor site (SAS) of the OAS1 gene in relation to the interferon response and status of HCV infection.\",\"Danoprevir is a potent and selective inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A serine protease.

This multiple rising dose trial evaluated antiviral activity and safety in chronic HCV genotype-1 patients.\",\"The current treatment regimen for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is peg-interferon plus ribavirin combination therapy. The majority of developing therapeutic strategies also contain peg-interferon with or without ribavirin. However, interferon is expensive and sometimes intolerable for some patients because of severe side effects.\",\"Polymorphisms of the IL28B gene (rs12979860 and rs8099917) are associated with high sustained virological response (SVR) rates in HCV genotype 1 patients. This study analyzes the impact of these IL28B polymorphisms on early treatment response (weeks 2 and 4) and SVR in HCV genotype 3 patients.\",\"Common genetic variation within the IL28 locus has been found to influence the effect of peg-interferon and ribavirin combination therapy against chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

HCV polyprotein processing and replication have been identified as the most promising viral targets. However, viral entry and fusion, RNA translation, virus assembly and release and several host cell factors may provide alternative attractive targets for future anti-HCV therapies. Inhibitors of the HCV NS3/4A protease are currently the most advanced in clinical development. Monotherapy with protease inhibitors has shown high antiviral activity, but is associated with frequent selection of resistant HCV variants, often resulting in viral breakthrough. However, there is encouraging evidence from phase 2/3 trials indicating that the addition of a protease inhibitor (e.g. telaprevir and boceprevir) to pegylated interferon-\\u03b1/ribavirin substantially improves sustained virological response rates in both treatment-na\\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 1. Nucleos(t)ide inhibitors of the HCV NS5B polymerase have shown variable antiviral activity against different HCV genotypes, but seem to have a higher genetic barrier to resistance than protease inhibitors. In addition, several allosteric binding sites have been identified for non-nucleoside inhibitors of the NS5B polymerase. However, the development of a substance with high antiviral activity and a high genetic barrier to resistance seems to be difficult. Among the different host cell-targeting compounds in early clinical development, cyclophilin inhibitors have shown the most promising results. Although advances have also been made in improving interferons, combinations of antiviral agents with different mechanisms of action may lead to the eventual possibility of interferon-free regimens.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C is associated with an increased prevalence of insulin resistance, which might result from liver disease, metabolic factors, or the hepatitis C virus (HCV) itself. The effect of antiviral treatment on insulin sensitivity is not well-known. We evaluated changes in insulin resistance and weight in patients with hepatitis C during and after peginterferon and ribavirin therapy.\",\"Several host and viral factors have been reported to influence the effectiveness of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C. In Japan, where the age of treated patients is comparatively high, recent studies have reported poor response to treatment in older female patients, but little is known about the relationship between advanced age in women and previously reported factors.\",\"A lack of antiviral response in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with pegylated (PEG)-interferon (IFN)-\\u03b1-2a + ribavirin (RIBA) may be explained by neutralizing antibodies to IFN-\\u03b1-2a. The aim of this study was to assess neutralizing antibodies to IFN-\\u03b1-2a and IFN levels in non-responder patients who were re-treated by PEG IFN-\\u03b1-2a and RIBA for 12 weeks. Non-responders to a first-line treatment of PEG IFN-\\u03b1-2a + RIBA were included for treatment with PEG IFN-\\u03b1-2a (180 \\u00b5g/week) + RIBA (1,000 mg/day if <75 kg, 1,200 mg otherwise) for 48 weeks. HCV RNA was measured at week 12. IFN levels and neutralizing antibodies to IFN-\\u03b1-2a were measured retrospectively on stored sera at baseline and weeks 4 and 12, using a quantitative sandwich ELISA for neutralizing antibodies to IFN-\\u03b1-2a. Twenty-three patients were non-responders and 19 patients were responders at week 12 of the initial phase of the second-line treatment. Non-responders and responders did not differ statistically: baseline age (median age 47 vs. 50 years), HCV RNA (median 6.8 vs. 6.4 log(10) copies/ml), gender (70% vs. 73% males), genotype (genotype 1: 91% vs. 80%). The median IFN-\\u03b1-2a levels (pg/ml) at weeks 0, 4, and 12 (interquartile range) did not differ between the 19 responders to initial phase of second-line treatment and the 23 non-responders: <3.3 (<3.3-371.4), 1457.3 (106.8-3284.8), and 1,652 (90.8-5,000); 84.5 (3.3-277.4), 1407.4 (120.2-2443.4), and 1620.1 (120.2-2287.1), respectively. Among non-selected consecutive non-responder patients, re-treatment with PEG IFN-\\u03b1-2a + RIBA is associated with virological response regardless of the presence of antibody-mediated resistance to conventional IFN treatment.\",\"Few studies evaluated the efficacy of HCV re-treatment and the predictors of response in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. The role of insulin resistance as a predictor of response in this population is unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pegylated interferon-\\u03b1-2a and ribavirin in re-treatment of HIV/HCV co-infected patients, predictors of sustained virological response, including insulin resistance, and the relationship between insulin resistance and liver histology.\",\"Classical antiviral therapies target viral proteins and are consequently subject to resistance. To counteract this limitation, alternative strategies have been developed that target cellular factors. We hypothesized that such an approach could also be useful to identify broad-spectrum antivirals. The influenza A virus was used as a model for its viral diversity and because of the need to develop therapies against unpredictable viruses as recently underlined by the H1N1 pandemic. We proposed to identify a gene-expression signature associated with infection by different influenza A virus subtypes which would allow the identification of potential antiviral drugs with a broad anti-influenza spectrum of activity. We analyzed the cellular gene expression response to infection with five different human and avian influenza A virus strains and identified 300 genes as differentially expressed between infected and non-infected samples. The most 20 dysregulated genes were used to screen the connectivity map, a database of drug-associated gene expression profiles. Candidate antivirals were then identified by their inverse correlation to the query signature. We hypothesized that such molecules would induce an unfavorable cellular environment for influenza virus replication. Eight potential antivirals including ribavirin were identified and their effects were tested in vitro on five influenza A strains. Six of the molecules inhibited influenza viral growth. The new pandemic H1N1 virus, which was not used to define the gene expression signature of infection, was inhibited by five out of the eight identified molecules, demonstrating that this strategy could contribute to identifying new broad anti-influenza agents acting on cellular gene expression. The identified infection signature genes, the expression of which are modified upon infection, could encode cellular proteins involved in the viral life cycle. This is the first study showing that gene expression-based screening can be used to identify antivirals. Such an approach could accelerate drug discovery and be extended to other pathogens.\",\"Treatment-induced control and spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are affected by various host factors. Polymorphisms in the region of the gene IL28B are associated with HCV clearance, implicating the gene product, interferon (IFN)-\\u03bb3, in the immune response to HCV. Although it is not clear how the IL28B haplotype affects HCV clearance, IFN-\\u03bb3 up-regulates interferon-stimulated genes, similar to IFN-\\u03b1 and IFN-\\u03b2 but via a different receptor. There is also evidence that IFN-\\u03bb3 affects the adaptive immune response. The IL28B genotype can be considered, along with other factors, in predicting patient responses to therapy with pegylated IFN-\\u03b1 and ribavirin. We review the genetic studies that uncovered the association between IL28B and HCV clearance, the biology of IFN-\\u03bb3, the clinical implications of the genetic association, and areas of future research.\",\"RG7128 (prodrug of PSI-6130) shows potent antiviral efficacy in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1, 2, or 3, with mean viral load decreases of 2.7 and 5 log(10) IU/mL, respectively, associated with 1500-mg doses twice daily after monotherapy for 2 weeks and with 1000-mg and 1500-mg doses twice daily after treatment in combination with the standard of care (SOC) for 4 weeks.\",\"Recent development of proteomic array technology, including protein profiling coupling ProteinChip array with surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF/MS), provides a potentially powerful tool for discovery of new biomarkers by comparison of its profiles according to patient phenotypes. We used this approach to identify the host factors associated with treatment response in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) receiving a 48-wk course of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) alpha 2b plus ribavirin (RBV). Protein profiles of pretreatment serum samples from 32 patients with genotype 1b and high viral load were conducted by SELDI-TOF/MS by using the three different ProteinChip arrays (CM10, Q10, IMAC30). Proteins showed significantly different peak intensities between sustained virological responders (SVRs), and non-SVRs were identified by chromatography, SDS-PAGE, TOF/MS and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) assay. Eleven peak intensities were significantly different between SVRs and non-SVRs. The three SVR-increased peaks could be identified as two apolipoprotein (Apo) fragments and albumin and, among the eight non-SVR-increased proteins, four peaks identified as two iron-related and two fibrogenesis-related protein fragments, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the serum ferritin and three peak intensity values (Apo A1, hemopexin and transferrin) were independent variables associated with SVRs, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for SVR prediction by using the Apo A1/hemopexin and hemopexin/transferrin were 0.964 and 0.936. In conclusion, pretreatment serum protein profiling by SELDI-TOF/MS is variable for identification of response-related host factors, which are useful for treatment efficacy prediction in CHC receiving PEG-IFN plus RBV. Our data also may help us understand the mechanism for treatment resistance and development of more effective antiviral therapy targeted toward the modulation of lipogenesis or iron homeostasis in CHC patients.\",\"Resistance of viruses to mutagenic agents is an important problem for the development of lethal mutagenesis as an antiviral strategy. Previous studies with RNA viruses have documented that resistance to the mutagenic nucleoside analogue ribavirin (1-\\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl-1-H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) is mediated by amino acid substitutions in the viral polymerase that either increase the general template copying fidelity of the enzyme or decrease the incorporation of ribavirin into RNA. Here we describe experiments that show that replication of the important picornavirus pathogen foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in the presence of increasing concentrations of ribavirin results in the sequential incorporation of three amino acid substitutions (M296I, P44S and P169S) in the viral polymerase (3D). The main biological effect of these substitutions is to attenuate the consequences of the mutagenic activity of ribavirin -by avoiding the biased repertoire of transition mutations produced by this purine analogue-and to maintain the replicative fitness of the virus which is able to escape extinction by ribavirin. This is achieved through alteration of the pairing behavior of ribavirin-triphosphate (RTP), as evidenced by in vitro polymerization assays with purified mutant 3Ds. Comparison of the three-dimensional structure of wild type and mutant polymerases suggests that the amino acid substitutions alter the position of the template RNA in the entry channel of the enzyme, thereby affecting nucleotide recognition. The results provide evidence of a new mechanism of resistance to a mutagenic nucleoside analogue which allows the virus to maintain a balance among mutation types introduced into progeny genomes during replication under strong mutagenic pressure.\",\"Insulin resistance (IR) is a major predictor of treatment failure in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection treated with peginterferon/ribavirin. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term effect of an HCV protease inhibitor monotherapy on IR in parallel with an antiviral effect.\",\"Less than half of patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) achieve sustained viral clearance after pegylated interferon (peginterferon) and ribavirin therapy. S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) improves interferon signaling in cell culture. We assessed the effect of SAMe on the kinetics of the early antiviral response and interferon signaling in nonresponders to previous antiviral therapy and investigated the mechanisms involved.\",\"To investigate the independent association between the homeostasis model assessment of the insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score and rapid virological response (RVR) and sustained virological response (SVR) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC).\",\"Small molecule inhibitors of hepatitis C virus (HCV) are being developed to complement or replace treatments with pegylated interferons and ribavirin, which have poor response rates and significant side effects. Resistance to these inhibitors emerges rapidly in the clinic, suggesting that successful therapy will involve combination therapy with multiple inhibitors of different targets. The entry process of HCV into hepatocytes represents another series of potential targets for therapeutic intervention, involving viral structural proteins that have not been extensively explored due to experimental limitations. To discover HCV entry inhibitors, we utilized HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp) incorporating E1-E2 envelope proteins from a genotype 1b clinical isolate. Screening of a small molecule library identified a potent HCV-specific triazine inhibitor, EI-1. A series of HCVpp with E1-E2 sequences from various HCV isolates was used to show activity against all genotype 1a and 1b HCVpp tested, with median EC50 values of 0.134 and 0.027 \\u00b5M, respectively. Time-of-addition experiments demonstrated a block in HCVpp entry, downstream of initial attachment to the cell surface, and prior to or concomitant with bafilomycin inhibition of endosomal acidification. EI-1 was equally active against cell-culture adapted HCV (HCVcc), blocking both cell-free entry and cell-to-cell transmission of virus. HCVcc with high-level resistance to EI-1 was selected by sequential passage in the presence of inhibitor, and resistance was shown to be conferred by changes to residue 719 in the carboxy-terminal transmembrane anchor region of E2, implicating this envelope protein in EI-1 susceptibility. Combinations of EI-1 with interferon, or inhibitors of NS3 or NS5A, resulted in additive to synergistic activity. These results suggest that inhibitors of HCV entry could be added to replication inhibitors and interferons already in development.\",\"Despite recent success after the introduction of combination therapy with interferon (IFN)-\\u03b1 and ribavirin, approximately 60% of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4 fail to respond. Resistance to antiviral therapy remains a serious problem in the management of chronic hepatitis C. In most patients, HCV RNA could be detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC).\",\"The mechanisms of treatment resistance to interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (Rib) combination therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are not known. This study aims to gain insight into these mechanisms by exploring hepatic gene expression before and during treatment.\",\"By mathematically describing early hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA decay after initiation of interferon (IFN)-based antiviral therapy, crucial parameters of the in vivo viral kinetics have been estimated, such as the rate of production and clearance of free virus, and the rate of loss of infected cells. Furthermore, by suggesting mechanisms of action for IFN and ribavirin mathematical modelling has provided a means for evaluating and optimizing treatment strategies. Here, we review recent modelling developments for understanding complex viral kinetics patterns, such as triphasic HCV RNA declines and viral rebounds observed in patients treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Moreover, we discuss new modelling approaches developed to interpret the viral kinetics observed in clinical trials with direct-acting antiviral agents, which induce a rapid decline of wild-type virus but also engender a higher risk for emergence of drug-resistant variants. Lastly, as in vitro systems have allowed a better characterization of the virus lifecycle, we discuss new modelling approaches that combine the intracellular and the extracellular viral dynamics.\",\"Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease frequently undergo orthotopic liver transplantation, but recurrent hepatitis C is still a major cause of morbidity. Patients are treated with peg-interferon and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV), which has substantial side effects and is costly. We investigated genetic factors of host, liver donor, and virus that might predict sensitivity of patients with recurrent hepatitis C to PEG-IFN/RBV.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem, but the current therapy is effective in <50% of patients infected with genotype 1. With advances in cell culture systems over the past decade, the development of directly acting antivirals (DAAs) for HCV has become possible. There are currently >50 active clinical trials in this therapeutic area and NS3/4A protease inhibitors are now entering Phase III study. To date, we have learned that DAAs are potent inhibitors of HCV replication, resulting in rapid declines in serum HCV RNA levels, and have the potential to allow shortening of therapy. However, these agents drive selective pressure for mutant viruses that can develop rapidly and have reduced susceptibility to the drug. Therefore, for now, the current standard of care including pegylated interferon \\u03b1 (pegIFN) and ribavirin remains a crucial part of new drug development. Furthermore, the adverse event profile for the early DAAs has added to the concerns of tolerability that are so common for the current standard of care. Ongoing issues include the optimal duration of therapy, how and when to combine DAAs, and the long-term role of pegIFN and ribavirin. Here, we summarize the current information regarding the effectiveness of protease inhibitors in treating chronic HCV and discuss the key challenges now facing the field.\",\"Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection for whom prior treatment of HCV with interferon-ribavirin has failed may require subsequent treatment with new HCV protease inhibitors (PIs). We evaluated the diversity of HCV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) in 26 HCV- and HIV-coinfected patients receiving stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) who were treated with interferon-ribavirin. Plasma HCV RNA clonal analysis was performed. There was greater baseline NS3 diversity in patients with nonresponse or relapse than in those with sustained virologic response. Interferon-ribavirin treatment did not result in significant changes in HCV protease gene diversity or significant HCV PI resistance mutations. The effect of prior interferon-ribavirin treatment on HCV NS3 will likely not impact HCV PI efficacy in HIV-coinfected patients receiving ART.\",\"Infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) continues to be a major global health problem. To overcome the limitations of current therapies using interferon-\\u03b1 in combination with ribavirin, there is a need to develop drugs that specifically block viral proteins. Highly efficient protease and polymerase inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical testing and will become available in the next few years. However, with resistance mutations emerging quickly, additional enzymatic activities or functions of HCV have to be targeted by novel compounds. One candidate molecule is the nonstructural protein 2 (NS2), which contains a proteolytic activity that is essential for viral RNA replication. In addition, NS2 is crucial for the assembly of progeny virions and modulates various cellular processes that interfere with viral replication. This review describes the functions of NS2 in the life cycle of HCV and highlights potential antiviral strategies involving NS2.\",\"The emergence of pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses in April 2009 and the continuous evolution of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses underscore the urgency of novel approaches to chemotherapy for human influenza infection. Anti-influenza drugs are currently limited to the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) and to M2 ion channel blockers (amantadine and rimantadine), although resistance to the latter class develops rapidly. Potential targets for the development of new anti-influenza agents include the viral polymerase (and endonuclease), the hemagglutinin, and the non-structural protein NS1. The limitations of monotherapy and the emergence of drug-resistant variants make combination chemotherapy the logical therapeutic option. Here we review the experimental data on combination chemotherapy with currently available agents and the development of new agents and therapy targets.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global medical problem. The role of Nitric oxide (NO) in chronic viral hepatitis is still unknown. It may play a prominent role as an antiviral agent that reduces its replication or as a mediator that causes accumulation of oxidative DNA damage and oncogenesis. The present study was carried out to study effect of combined peginterferon and ribavirin therapy for hepatitis C on NO in both responders and in non responder patients. The study included seventy three patients with positive serological markers for HCV. They were classified according to presence or absence of HCV viremia and the response to therapy. In addition sixteen control subjects were included. NO levels were determined as the stable end product nitrate and nitrite. Serum nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the patients with viral hepatitis were significantly higher than normal subjects and patients with serological evidence of hepatitis C infection in absence of viral load. The levels of nitrite >or= 31 microM, nitrate >or= 15 microM and NO(2)/NO(3) ratio < 1.5 microM were associated with increased risk of resistance to therapy. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NO(2)/NO(3) ratio at levels < 1.5 microM was associated with HCV eradication independently. This study provides new insight into the pathogenesis of hepatitis C and highlights the effect of combined peginterferon and ribavirin on nitrite and nitrate as markers of endogenous NO system. There is a limitation level of NO that if it is increased above it may lead to non response to antiviral therapy. Therefore, it may be an important factor for chronic hepatitis C, which suggests an additional therapeutic pathway of anti-oxidants in combination with the standard regimen for further study.\",\"As combination therapy with peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin has a high morbidity, identifying individuals with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who will not respond to the treatment would be beneficial. The early responses of serum HCV RNA levels to standard interferon (IFN) and PEG-IFN were examined to determine if it was possible to identify resistance to combination therapy. One hundred thirty-one patients infected with HCV genotype 1b were enrolled. Patients were given 6 MU of standard IFN alpha-2b at least 2 weeks before initiating combination therapy. Serum HCV RNA levels were measured before, 24 hr after the administration of standard IFN, and 24 hr after the administration of PEG-IFN (at the start of the combination therapy). The association between reductions in HCV RNA levels at 24 hr after the administration of standard IFN and PEG-IFN and the outcome of combination therapy were analyzed. Reductions in HCV RNA levels were poorer in patients who did not respond than in those with a sustained virologic responses or relapses (P < 0.0001), both 24 hr after the administration of standard IFN and 24 hr after the administration of PEG-IFN. Reductions in HCV RNA levels 24 hr after the administration of standard IFN were an independent factor associated with non-response by multivariate analysis. An early reduction in viral load to a single administration of standard IFN is a useful predictor of non-response in patients with HCV genotype 1, allowing for pretreatment identification of patients who will not benefit from combination therapy.\",\"Treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has evolved considerably in the last years. The standard of care (SOC) for HCV infection consists in the combination of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin. However, it only induces a sustained virological response (SVR) in half of genotype 1-infected patients. Several viral and host factors have been associated with non-response: steatosis, obesity, insulin resistance, age, male sex, ethnicity and genotypes. Many studies have demonstrated that in non-responders, some interferon-stimulated genes were upregulated before treatment. Those findings associated to clinical, biochemical and histological data may help detect responders before starting any treatment. This is a very important issue because the standard treatment is physically and economically demanding. The future of HCV treatment would probably consist in the addition of specifically targeted antiviral therapy for HCV such as protease and/or polymerase inhibitors to the SOC. In genotype 1 patients, very promising results have been reported when the protease inhibitor telaprevir or boceprevir is added to the SOC. It increases the SVR rates from approximately 50% (PEG-IFN plus ribavirin) to 70% (for patients treated with a combination of PEG-IFN plus ribavirin plus telaprevir). Different elements are associated with non-response: (i) viral factors, (ii) host factors and (iii) molecular mechanisms induced by HCV proteins to inhibit the IFN signalling pathway. The goal of this review is to present the mechanisms of non-response, to overcome it and to identify factors that can help to predict the response to anti-HCV therapy.\",\"This study explored gene expression differences in predicting response to pegylated interferon (IFN-PEG) and ribavirin (RBV) in hepatitis C infection. Current treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) with IFN-PEG alpha-2a/b and RBV is an expensive regimen with frequent significant side-effects where less than 60% of patients ultimately achieve a sustained virological response. Responders and nonresponders may not be identified for up to 6 months post-treatment. This dichotomy may be because of differences in the molecular genetic response.\",\"The current treatment of chronic hepatitis C based on the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin is effective in only 50% of patients. Specific targeted antiviral therapies represent a promising approach to eradicate the infection.\",\"Liver disease related to infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in this era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Although progress has been made in the treatment of HBV and HCV in the setting of HIV-coinfection, there is a lack of data in certain areas and several aspects of the management are unclear at this time.\",\"Studies on the association between sequence variability of the interferon sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) of hepatitis C virus and the outcome of treatment have reached conflicting results. In this study, 25 patients infected with HCV 6a who had received interferon-alpha/ribavirin combination treatment were analyzed for the sequence variations. 14 of them had the full genome sequences obtained from a previous study, whereas the other 11 samples were sequenced for the extended ISDR (eISDR). This eISDR fragment covers 192 bp (64 amino acids) upstream and 201 bp (67 amino acids) downstream from the ISDR previously defined for HCV 1b. The comparison between interferon-alpha resistance and response groups for the amino acid mutations located in the full genome (6 and 8 patients respectively) as well as the mutations located in the eISDR (10 and 15 patients respectively) showed that the mutations I2160V, I2256V, V2292I (P<0.05) within eISDR were significantly associated with resistance to treatment. However, the extent of amino acid variations within previously defined ISDR was not associated with resistance to treatment as previously reported. Four amino acid variations I248V (P=0.03-0.06) within E1, R445K (P=0.02-0.05) and S747T (P=0.03) within E2, I861V (P=0.01) within NS2 which located outside the eISDR may also associate with treatment outcome as identified by a prescreening of variations within 14 HCV 6a full genomes.\",\"The treatment response to interferon could differ with mutations in the interferon-sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype-1b (HCV-Ib). We examined the pattern of ISDR mutations and analyzed whether the number of amino acid substitutions influences the treatment response to peginterferon plus ribavirin in chronic hepatitis or cirrhotic patients infected with HCV-Ib.\",\"The combination of pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin is currently the standard of care antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CHC), but optimal results require an individual approach. Key issues are to deliver doses that confer optimal antiviral efficacy against hepatitis C virus (HCV) for a time sufficient to minimise relapse. Viral monitoring during therapy guides the subsequent treatment course, particularly HCV RNA results at 4 weeks (rapid viral response [RVR]) and 12 weeks (complete early viral response [cEVR]). There is strong evidence that for most patients with genotypes 2 or 3 HCV infection, RVR allows truncation of treatment to 16 weeks, provided ribavirin dose is weight-based. However, those patients with cirrhosis, insulin resistance/diabetes or older than 50 years need 6-12 months treatment. For \\\"difficult-to-treat\\\" CHC (genotypes 1 and 4), RVR is infrequent (approximately 15% in European studies), but allows treatment to be truncated from 48 to 24 weeks. Without RVR, there is some evidence that longer treatment (72 weeks) improves sustained viral response (SVR). However, \\\"induction dosing\\\" first 12 weeks of PEG-IFN clearly does not improve SVR. To prevent dose reductions and complete therapy, it is critical to detect and treat depression and other disabling side-effects, including judicious use of growth factors for severe anemia or neutropenia and possibly, thrombocytopenia. Another potentially important aspect may be attempts to counter central obesity and insulin resistance, which confer suboptimal antiviral response with any HCV genotype. Treatment partnerships with specialist nurses, psychological therapists and other healthcare workers are also essential for optimal individual management of patients with CHC.\",\"We prospectively compared the sensitivity to interferon (IFN) and the efficacy of antiviral combination therapy with peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b infection according to the amino acid sequences of the HCV core, E1, and NS5A regions reported to be associated with the outcome of antiviral therapy.\",\"Ribavirin (RBV) is a synthetic nucleoside analog with broad spectrum antiviral activity. Although RBV is approved for the treatment of hepatitis C virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Lassa fever virus infections, its mechanism of action and therapeutic efficacy remains highly controversial. Recent reports show that the development of cell-based resistance after continuous RBV treatment via decreased RBV uptake can greatly limit its efficacy. Here, we examined whether certain cell types are naturally resistant to RBV even without prior drug exposure. Seven different cell lines from various host species were compared for RBV antiviral activity against two nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, a rhabdovirus) and Sendai virus (SeV, a paramyxovirus). Our results show striking differences between cell types in their response to RBV, ranging from virtually no antiviral effect to very effective inhibition of viral replication. Despite differences in viral replication kinetics for VSV and SeV in the seven cell lines, the observed pattern of RBV resistance was very similar for both viruses, suggesting that cellular rather than viral determinants play a major role in this resistance. While none of the tested cell lines was defective in RBV uptake, dramatic variations were observed in the long-term accumulation of RBV in different cell types, and it correlated with the antiviral efficacy of RBV. While addition of guanosine neutralized RBV only in cells already highly resistant to RBV, actinomycin D almost completely reversed the RBV effect (but not uptake) in all cell lines. Together, our data suggest that RBV may inhibit the same virus via different mechanisms in different cell types depending on the intracellular RBV metabolism. Our results strongly point out the importance of using multiple cell lines of different origin when antiviral efficacy and potency are examined for new as well as established drugs in vitro.\",\"Controversy exists about whether insulin resistance (IR) affects response to treatment of hepatitis C. We evaluated the effect of IR on sustained virologic response (SVR) in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients treated with interferon plus ribavirin.\",\"1,2,3-Thiadiazoles, an important synthetic active substructure, are nowadays becoming one of the important branches in novel pesticide development. To develop pesticide candidates with diverse biological activities and probe their structure-activity relationship, three series of 5-methyl-1,2,3-thiadiazoles were rationally designed and synthesized using a simple and convenient one-step synthetic procedure via Ugi reaction. Biological activities of the target compounds including fungicidal activity, antivirus activity in vitro and in vivo, and systemic acquired resistance were systematically evaluated. The results indicated that compound III(10) showed broad-spectrum of activities against most fungi tested, and compounds I(10) and II(17) showed excellent potential antivirus activities as compared to positive control agent ribavirin. The preliminary structure-activity relationship was also discussed. The results of these studies indicated that the 5-position-substituted 1,2,3-thiadiazoles exhibited good antivirus activity and were worthy of further study in pesticide development.\",\"Conflicting results have been reported in studies evaluating the relationship between serum markers of iron overload, liver iron deposits, and HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) in chronic hepatitis C patients, and also their impact on the response to therapy in these patients.\",\"HCV is a leading cause of liver disease in the US, where ~3.4 million people are chronically infected. The standard of care (SOC) of pegylated IFN and ribavirin combination therapy has limited efficacy with ~50% sustained viral response, and is associated with a considerable adverse event profile in many patients. New drugs that directly target the virus are in development, and promise more effective therapies for chronic HCV infection.\",\"In a genome-wide association study of patients being treated for chronic hepatitis C, 2 functional variants in ITPA that cause inosine triphosphatase (ITPase) deficiency were shown to protect against ribavirin (RBV)-induced hemolytic anemia during early stages of treatment. We aimed to replicate this finding in an independent cohort from the Study of Viral Resistance to Antiviral Therapy of Chronic Hepatitis C and to investigate the effects of these variants beyond week 4.\",\"Many patients with chronic hepatitis C do not respond to antiviral treatment. In adult patients the re-treatment of these patients has been extensively investigated. Because the response to re-treatment in children is not well defined we evaluated the efficacy and safety of interferon (IFN)-alpha plus ribavirin in patients who have failed to respond to previous treatment.\",\"We recently identified a compound, clemizole hydrochloride, that inhibits NS4B's RNA binding and hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. Although significant, clemizole's antiviral effect is moderate (50% effective concentration of 8 microM against an HCV genotype 2a clone). We hypothesized that the combination of clemizole with other anti-HCV agents can increase the antiviral effect over that achieved with each drug alone and could also decrease the emergence of viral resistance.\",\"Insulin resistance has been found to be an independent factor predicting sustained response to peginterferon plus ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Insulin resistance seems to be involved in decreased sensitivity to interferon and could block interferon intracellular signaling. Insulin resistance promotes steatosis and fibrosis progression, induces pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and increases adipose tissue, decreasing interferon availability. Moreover, suppressor of cytokines 3 and protein tyrosine-phosphatase seems to be able to block interferon and insulin signaling, building a feed-forward loop. Insulin resistance can be treated with exercise, diet or through the use of drugs that improve insulin sensitivity, like biguanides or glitazones. A recent controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial (TRIC-1) examined the effect of adding metformin to standard therapy in the treatment of hepatitis C. This study demonstrated that women infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 and HOMA >2 treated with metformin showed a greater drop in viral load during the first 12 weeks and a doubled sustained viral response in comparison with females receiving placebo. Pioglitazone has been used in previous nonresponders and na\\u00efve patients with disappointing results in two pilot trials. The mechanisms by which the virus promotes insulin resistance seems to be genotype-dependent and could explain, at least in part, the discrepancies between insulin sensitizers. Insulin resistance is a new target in the challenging management of chronic hepatitis C.\",\"Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are involved in the activation/inhibition of NK cells through an interaction with HLA class I molecules on target cells. Our study aimed to evaluate the association between KIR gene polymorphisms and the response of patients with CHC to antiviral therapy.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with a higher risk of the development of insulin resistance. If HCV is a causal factor for insulin resistance, then clearance of HCV might decrease insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of clearance of HCV on insulin resistance.\",\"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), members of the Picornaviridae family, are composed of over 100 different virus serotypes. Until now there is no recorded clinically effective antiviral chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of diseases caused by HRVs. Our previous study of raoulic acid tested against serotype human rhinoviruses showed anti-HRV2 (species A) and -3 (species B) activities. In this study, raoulic acid was found to possess broad-spectrum antiviral activity against six HRVs with a 50% inhibition concentration of less than 9.5 microg/mL through inhibition of the cellular absorption of the HRV particles. Furthermore, the effect of raoulic acid on resistance of HRV5 exhibited to pleconaril was more pronounced than the effect on HRV1b, -6, -14, -15, and -40. However, ribavirin did possess weak antiviral activity against HRVs. Collectively, the results demonstrate that raoulic acid is a novel therapeutic candidate for two different groups of human rhinovirus.\",\"The worldwide prevalence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is estimated to be approaching 200 million people. Current therapy relies upon a combination of pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin, a poorly tolerated regimen typically associated with less than 50% sustained virological response rate in those infected with genotype 1 virus. The development of direct-acting antiviral agents to treat HCV has focused predominantly on inhibitors of the viral enzymes NS3 protease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B. Here we describe the profile of BMS-790052, a small molecule inhibitor of the HCV NS5A protein that exhibits picomolar half-maximum effective concentrations (EC(50)) towards replicons expressing a broad range of HCV genotypes and the JFH-1 genotype 2a infectious virus in cell culture. In a phase I clinical trial in patients chronically infected with HCV, administration of a single 100-mg dose of BMS-790052 was associated with a 3.3 log(10) reduction in mean viral load measured 24 h post-dose that was sustained for an additional 120 h in two patients infected with genotype 1b virus. Genotypic analysis of samples taken at baseline, 24 and 144 h post-dose revealed that the major HCV variants observed had substitutions at amino-acid positions identified using the in vitro replicon system. These results provide the first clinical validation of an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, a protein with no known enzymatic function, as an approach to the suppression of virus replication that offers potential as part of a therapeutic regimen based on combinations of HCV inhibitors.\",\"Passage of poliovirus (PV) or foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in the presence of ribavirin selected for viruses with decreased sensitivity to R, which included different mutations in their polymerase (3D): G64S located in the finger subdomain in the case of PV and M296I located within loop beta9-alpha11 at the active site in the case of FMDV. To investigate why disparate substitutions were selected in two closely related 3Ds, we constructed FMDVs with a 3D that included either G62S (the equivalent replacement in FMDV of PV G64S), M296I, or both substitutions. G62S, but not M296I, inflicts upon FMDV a strong selective disadvantage which is partially compensated for by the substitution M296I. The corresponding mutant polymerases, 3D(G62S), 3D(M296I), and 3D(G62S-M296I), were analyzed functionally and structurally. G62S in 3D impairs RNA-binding, polymerization, and R monophosphate incorporation activities. The X-ray structures of the 3D(G62S)-RNA, 3D(M296I)-RNA, and 3D(G62S-M296I)-RNA complexes show that although the two positions are separated by 13.1 A, the loops where the replacements reside are tightly connected through an extensive network of interactions that reach the polymerase active site. In particular, G62S seems to restrict the flexibility of loop beta9-alpha11 and, as a consequence, the flexibility of the active site and its ability to bind the RNA template. Thus, a localized change in the finger subdomain of 3D may affect the catalytic domain. The results provide a structural interpretation of why different amino acid substitutions were selected to confer R resistance in closely related viruses and reveal a complex network of intra-3D interactions that can affect the recognition of both the RNA template and incoming nucleotide.\",\"Dendritic cell (DC) dysfunction has been suggested to play a role in the weak antiviral T-cell responsiveness observed during the course of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This study was undertaken to evaluate whether changes in DC functions might be related to a different therapeutic outcome in HCV-infected patients.\",\"Assessing hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA levels is integral to response-guided therapy. Rules for early discontinuation and determination of treatment duration were mainly established with HCV-RNA assays with a detection limit of 50IU/ml (COBAS Amplicor HCV [CA]). The currently used real-time PCR-based COBAS Ampliprep/COBAS-TaqMan HCV (CAP-CTM) test has a detection limit of approximately 10IU/ml. It is unknown whether shortening of treatment duration to 16/24 weeks in patients with rapid virological response at week 4 (RVR) and viral loads between 10 and 50IU/ml is possible.\",\"More than 50% of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients do not respond to the classical pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin combination therapy. However, failing to respond to one course of treatment is not synonymous of therapy failure and retreatment is often beneficial. Alternative retreatment strategies include repeating the classical standard of care with an optimized drug regimen and adherence, including ribavirin serum concentration adjustment, correcting, if at all possible, comorbidities, and the addition of new specific anti-HCV molecules to the backbone of pegylated interferon/ribavirin. Options of retreatment should include consensus and natural interferons. For patients with advanced disease exposed to a high risk of lethal complications, customized maintenance therapy could be an effective option since it may slow down complications in some patients. Since low-dose interferon monotherapy is not sufficient, such a maintenance therapy remains to be verified via clinical trials. New possibilities of noninvasive assessment of fibrosis and the use of genetic tests to predict fibrosis progression and responsiveness to interferon are major emerging opportunities that run parallel to the revolution of the pharmacologic armentarium.\",\"Favipiravir (T-705) has previously been shown to have a potent antiviral effect against influenza virus and some other RNA viruses in both cell culture and in animal models. Currently, favipiravir is undergoing clinical evaluation for the treatment of influenza A and B virus infections. In this study, favipiravir was evaluated in vitro for its ability to inhibit the replication of a representative panel of seasonal influenza viruses, the 2009 A(H1N1) strains, and animal viruses with pandemic (pdm) potential (swine triple reassortants, H2N2, H4N2, avian H7N2, and avian H5N1), including viruses which are resistant to the currently licensed anti-influenza drugs. All viruses were tested in a plaque reduction assay with MDCK cells, and a subset was also tested in both yield reduction and focus inhibition (FI) assays. For the majority of viruses tested, favipiravir significantly inhibited plaque formation at 3.2 muM (0.5 microg/ml) (50% effective concentrations [EC(50)s] of 0.19 to 22.48 muM and 0.03 to 3.53 microg/ml), and for all viruses, with the exception of a single dually resistant 2009 A(H1N1) virus, complete inhibition of plaque formation was seen at 3.2 muM (0.5 microg/ml). Due to the 2009 pandemic and increased drug resistance in circulating seasonal influenza viruses, there is an urgent need for new drugs which target influenza. This study demonstrates that favipiravir inhibits in vitro replication of a wide range of influenza viruses, including those resistant to currently available drugs.\",\"The results of post-transplant antiviral therapy for recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) are poor, and significant pre-transplant predictors for sustained viral response (SVR) have not yet been identified.\",\"Recent advances in the development of agents that act specifically to inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) are set to fundamentally change the way that patients will be treated. New directly acting anti-HCV agents such as protease and polymerase inhibitors will initially be added to standard of care with pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin. However, future therapy is likely to constitute combinations of agents which act at distinct stages of viral replication and have differing resistance profiles. While directly acting anti-HCV agents will undoubtedly improve treatment outcomes, the introduction of combination therapy may not be without complications in some patient groups. HIV-positive patients who are receiving antiretrovirals (ARVs) are relatively highly represented among those with HCV infection, and are at high risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). As combination anti-HCV treatment gradually evolves to resemble anti-HIV therapy, it is essential to consider the increased potential for DDIs in patients receiving combination anti-HCV therapy, and particularly in HCV/HIV-co-infected individuals. Therapeutic drug monitoring is likely to play a role in the clinical management of such interactions.\",\"Small-molecule hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitors such as boceprevir (SCH 503034) have been shown to have antiviral activity when they are used as monotherapy and in combination with pegylated alpha interferon and ribavirin in clinical trials. Improvements in inhibitor potency and pharmacokinetic properties offer opportunities to increase drug exposure and to further increase the sustained virological response. Exploration of the structure-activity relationships of ketoamide inhibitors related to boceprevir has led to the discovery of SCH 900518, a novel ketoamide protease inhibitor which forms a reversible covalent bond with the active-site serine. It has an overall inhibition constant (K*(i)) of 7 nM and a dissociation half-life of 1 to 2 h. SCH 900518 inhibited replicon RNA at a 90% effective concentration (EC(90)) of 40 nM. In biochemical assays, SCH 900518 was active against proteases of genotypes 1 to 3. A 2-week treatment with 5x EC(90) of the inhibitor reduced the replicon RNA level by 3 log units. Selection of replicon cells with SCH 900518 resulted in the outgrowth of several resistant mutants (with the T54A/S and A156S/T/V mutations). Cross-resistance studies demonstrated that the majority of mutations for resistance to boceprevir and telaprevir caused similar fold losses of activity against all three inhibitors; however, SCH 900518 retained more activity against these mutants due to its higher intrinsic potency. Combination treatment with alpha interferon enhanced the inhibition of replicon RNA and suppressed the emergence of resistant replicon colonies, supporting the use of SCH 900518-pegylated alpha interferon combination therapy in the clinic. In summary, the results of the preclinical characterization of the antiviral activity of SCH 900518 support its evaluation in clinical studies.\",\"In patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) of genotype 4, the predictors of rapid virologic response (RVR) have not been determined adequately. We aimed to assess which pretreatment variables might predict an RVR and a sustained virologic response (SVR).\",\"The present review discusses recent developments in drug discovery for hepatitis C. We are on the verge of a new era with the introduction of direct acting oral agents that will transform the treatment landscape. Both healthcare providers and patients need to stay abreast of these changes that will influence decisions to treat. This article will discuss the most promising up-to-date hepatitis C virus antiviral therapies in clinical investigation as well as the associated clinical trial results.\",\"The objective of this analysis was to identify predictors of relapse in genotype 1 patients after 48 weeks of treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin.\",\"Insulin resistance is a predictive factor of response to treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin in patients with hepatitis C. Insulin resistance impairs sensitivity to interferon and can block its intracellular signalling. Insulin resistance also induces the development of steatosis, progression of fibrosis and proinflammatory cytokine release and reduces the bioavailability of interferon. Suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 and protein tyrosine phosphatases are involved in blocking the intracellular signalling of interferon and insulin. Insulin resistance can be treated through diet, physical exercise and the use of insulin-sensitizing agents such as biguanides or glitazones. The TRIC-1 study demonstrated that adding metformin to routine treatment improves the possibilities of cure in women and in patients whose insulin sensitivity returns to normal during treatment.\",\"The association of hepatitis C virus genotype 4 (HCV-4) with hepatic steatosis has not been clarified. We aimed to determine the parameters associated with steatosis among HCV-4 patients and to assess the effect of steatosis on treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin.\",\"Pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) alfa-2b plus ribavirin (RBV) is the standard of care for adults with chronic hepatitis C but was not approved for the treatment of children at the time of this study. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PEG-IFN alfa-2b plus RBV in children.\",\"The rapid emergence and subsequent spread of the novel 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 virus (2009 H1N1) has prompted the World Health Organization to declare the first pandemic of the 21st century, highlighting the threat of influenza to public health and healthcare systems. Widespread resistance to both classes of influenza antivirals (adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors) occurs in both pandemic and seasonal viruses, rendering these drugs to be of marginal utility in the treatment modality. Worldwide, virtually all 2009 H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 strains are resistant to the adamantanes (rimantadine and amantadine), and the majority of seasonal H1N1 strains are resistant to oseltamivir, the most widely prescribed neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI). To address the need for more effective therapy, we evaluated the in vitro activity of a triple combination antiviral drug (TCAD) regimen composed of drugs with different mechanisms of action against drug-resistant seasonal and 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses. Amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir, alone and in combination, were tested against amantadine- and oseltamivir-resistant influenza A viruses using an in vitro infection model in MDCK cells. Our data show that the triple combination was highly synergistic against drug-resistant viruses, and the synergy of the triple combination was significantly greater than the synergy of any double combination tested (P<0.05), including the combination of two NAIs. Surprisingly, amantadine and oseltamivir contributed to the antiviral activity of the TCAD regimen against amantadine- and oseltamivir-resistant viruses, respectively, at concentrations where they had no activity as single agents, and at concentrations that were clinically achievable. Our data demonstrate that the TCAD regimen composed of amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir is highly synergistic against resistant viruses, including 2009 H1N1. The TCAD regimen overcomes baseline drug resistance to both classes of approved influenza antivirals, and thus may represent a highly active antiviral therapy for seasonal and pandemic influenza.\",\"The current standard of care for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, pegylated alpha interferon in combination with ribavirin, has a limited response rate and adverse side effects. Drugs targeting viral proteins are in clinical development, but they suffer from the development of high viral resistance. The inhibition of cellular proteins that are essential for viral amplification is thought to have a higher barrier to the emergence of resistance. Three cyclophilin inhibitors, the cyclosporine analogs DEBIO-025, SCY635, and NIM811, have shown promising results for the treatment of HCV infection in early clinical trials. In this study, we investigated the frequency and mechanism of resistance to cyclosporine (CsA), NIM811, and a structurally unrelated cyclophilin inhibitor, SFA-1, in replicon-containing Huh7 cells. Cross-resistance between all clones was observed. NIM811-resistant clones were selected only after obtaining initial resistance to either CsA or SFA-1. The time required to select resistance against cyclophilin inhibitors was significantly longer than that required for resistance selection against viral protein inhibitors, and the achievable resistance level was substantially lower. Resistance to cyclophilin inhibitors was mediated by amino acid substitutions in NS3, NS5A, and NS5B, with NS5A mutations conferring the majority of resistance. Mutation D320E in NS5A mediated most of the resistance conferred by NS5A. Taken together, the results indicate that there is a very low frequency and level of resistance to cyclophilin-binding drugs mediated by amino acid substitutions in three viral proteins. The interaction of cyclophilin with NS5A seems to be the most critical, since the NS5A mutations have the largest impact on resistance.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with an increased prevalence of diabetes and insulin resistance (IR); whether this is a causal relationship has not been established.\",\"To compare 14 and 24 weeks treatment to patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection and rapid virological response (RVR).\",\"Hepatic steatosis is commonly seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection, and the two together have a greater association than by chance alone. Hepatitis C virus is closely associated with lipid metabolism throughout its lifecycle. Hepatic steatosis is more common in genotype 3 infection, due to direct viral effects including through microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, peroxisome proliferator activating receptor, and sterol regulatory element binding protein. In non-genotype 3 infection, hepatic steatosis is considered largely to be due to alterations in host metabolism, particularly through insulin resistance. The clinical relevance of this association has yet to be fully explored. Hepatic steatosis is associated with increased hepatic fibrosis and a reduced level of sustained virological response to pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Small studies trialing adjuvant anti-diabetic therapies or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with pegylated-interferon and ribavirin have shown an improved sustained virological response and reduced viral titer. Furthermore, simple lifestyle alterations showed positive effects on parameters of disease activity. These insights raise the possibility of novel treatment options.\",\"The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivi are used to treat H5N1 influenza. However, oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 viruses have been isolated from oseltamivir-treated patients. Moreover, reassortment between H5N1 viruses and oseltamvir-resistant human H1N1 viruses currently circulating could create oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 viruses, rendering the oseltamivir stockpile obsolete. Therefore, there is a need for unique and effective antivirals to combat H5N1 influenza viruses. The investigational drug T-705 (favipiravir; 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) has antiviral activity against seasonal influenza viruses and a mouse-adapted H5N1 influenza virus derived from a benign duck virus. However, its efficacy against highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses, which are substantially more virulent, remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that T-705 effectively protects mice from lethal infection with oseltamivir-sensitive or -resistant highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. Furthermore, our biochemical analysis suggests that T-705 ribofuranosyl triphosphate, an active form of T-705, acts like purines or purine nucleosides in human cells and does not inhibit human DNA synthesis. We conclude that T-705 shows promise as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza patients.\",\"We investigated whether sustained virological response (SVR) and non-SVR by chronic hepatitis C patients to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) combination therapy are distinguishable by viral factors such as the IFN/RBV resistance-determining region (IRRDR) and by on-treatment factors through new indices such as the rebound index (RI). The first RI (RI-1st; the viral load at week 1 divided by the viral load at 24 h) and the second RI (RI-2nd; the viral load at week 2 divided by the viral load at 24 h) were calculated. The subject patients were divided into 3 groups based on RI-1st and RI-2nd: an RI-A group (RI-1st < or = 1.0), an RI-B group (RI-1st >1.0 and RI-2nd <0.7) and an RI-C group (RI-1st >1.0 and RI-2nd > or = 0.7). The SVR rate was 71.4% (10/14) in the RI-A group, 46.2% (6/13) in the RI-B group and 20.0% (3/15) in the RI-C group (p = 0.005 between the RI-A group and the RI-C group). In IRRDR > or = 6 and IRRDR < or = 5 the SVR rate was 81.3% (13/16) and 23.1% (6/26) (p = 0.0002), respectively. By combining RI and IRRDR as a predicting factor, the SVR rate was 87.5% (7/8) in the RI-A group (> or = 6 mutations in the IRRDR) and 7.7% (1/13) in the RI-C group (< or = 5 IRRDR mutations) (p = 0.0003).\",\"Ribavirin (RBV), a nucleoside analogue, is used in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in combination with interferons. However, potential mechanisms of RBV resistance during HCV replication remain poorly understood. Serial passage of cells harboring HCV genotype 2a replicon in the presence of RBV resulted in the reduced susceptibility of the replicon to RBV. Transfection of fresh cells with RNA from RBV-resistant replicon cells demonstrated that the RBV resistance observed is largely replicon-derived. Four major amino acid substitutions: T1134S in NS3, P1969S in NS4B, V2405A in NS5A, and Y2471H in NS5B region, were identified. Site-directed mutagenesis of these mutations into the replicon indicated that Y2471H plays a role in the reduced susceptibility to RBV and leads to decrease in replication fitness. The results, in addition to analysis of sequence database, suggest that HCV variants with reduced susceptibility to RBV identified are preferential to genotype 2a.\",\"Persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma and the major indication for liver transplantation in adults. Current standard of care treatment (SOC) with pegylated-interferon-\\u03b1 2 and ribavirin (RBV) has a limited efficacy and is associated with significant side effects frequently associated with poor compliance or treatment discontinuation, requiring specialized and frequent monitoring. To overcome the limited efficacy of SOC, more than 50 direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) designed to target viral-encoded proteins essential in the HCV life cycle are currently under development. The rapid selection of resistant mutants associated with the quasispecies nature of HCV with high mutation and replication rates is one of the main challenges for the new HCV therapies. Predictive host and viral factors together with combination of DAAs with or without IFN and/or RBV need to be accurately evaluated to design the most effective individualized treatment strategy within the shortest time interval and with minimum side effects.\",\"Abstract Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 4, 5 and 6 represent >20% of all HCV cases worldwide. HCV-4 is mainly seen in Egypt, where it represents 90% of all HCV cases. Antischistosomal therapy was the main cause of contamination there, followed by procedures performed by informal providers and traditional healers such as dental care, wound treatment, circumcision, deliveries, excision and scarification. It is also highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and in the Middle East. In Europe, its prevalence has recently increased particularly among intravenous drug users and in immigrants. HCV-5 is mainly found in South Africa, where it represents 40% of all HCV genotypes, but four pockets of HCV-5 were found in France, Spain, Syria and Belgium and sporadic cases were found elsewhere. The mode of transmission is mainly iatrogenic and transfusion. HCV-6 is found in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar and also in American and Australian from Asian origin. The response to treatment in HCV-4 is intermediate between HCV-1 and HCV-2 and HCV-3. A sustained viral response is achieved in 43-70% with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. It is higher in Egyptians than Europeans and Africans and is negatively related to insulin resistance and to the severity of fibrosis. It increases to >80% with 24 weeks of therapy only if a rapid virological response is achieved. In HCV-5, a sustained virological response is achieved in >60% with 48 weeks of therapy. HCV-6 is also considered an easy-to-treat genotype, leading to a response in 60-85% of cases.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one of the major causes of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure that leads to transplantation. The current standard treatment, a combination of pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin, eradicates the virus in only about 50% of patients. Directly acting antiviral (DAA) agents, which inhibit HCV replication, are in phase 1, 2, and 3 trials; these include reagents that target the nonstructural (NS)3 protease, the NS5A protein, the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase NS5B, as well as compounds that directly inhibit HCV replication through interaction with host cell proteins. Because of the high genetic heterogeneity of HCV and its rapid replication, monotherapy with DAA agents poses a high risk for selection of resistant variants. We review the parameters that determine resistance, genotypic and phenotypic resistance profiles of DAA agents, and strategies to avoid the selection of resistant variants.\",\"The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection varies across the world, with the highest number of infections reported in Egypt. Expression of the MxA gene has been found to be a reliable and sensitive marker for the induction of endogenous type I interferons (IFNs) during viral infections. This study examined the correlation of gene expression of MxA with the response to treatment with pegylated-IFN-alfa2b and ribavirin. Fifty patients with type 4 HCV and 20 healthy volunteers as controls were enrolled in a prospective study designed with strict inclusion criteria to nullify the effect of confounding variables and further minimize selection bias. Quantification of HCV-RNA and MxA gene by real-time PCR was performed for every patient, and quantification of MxA gene was performed for controls. There was a statistically significant difference between patients and control group as regards the quantity of MxA gene expression (P < 0.05) (Mann-Whitney test) (P = 0.004). There was a statistically significant difference between responders and nonresponders (P < 0.05): responders showed a higher percentage of cases with initial MxA <2(6) (P < 0.05). We conclude that MxA protein expression is a sensitive biological marker for ongoing virus replication and presence of type 1 IFN. These results highlight the importance of the detection of MxA expression at the start of therapy as a factor for assessing the likelihood of HCV genotype 4 patients to achieving a sustained virological response to treatment with IFN-\\u03b12 in combination with ribavirin.\",\"One year of interferon therapy inhibits HBV replication in one third of the patients whereas long-term administration of oral nucleos(t)ide analogues is efficient in most of them, as long as early treatment adaptation in patients with partial virological response and resistance is provided. Following the demonstration of a more potent antiviral effect in terms of sustained virological response (SVR) rates, Pegylated-IFN coupled with Ribavirin has become the standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C, with nearly 65% of all treated patients achieving a SVR. Long-term suppression of HBV and eradication of HCV would halt the progression of chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver decompensation.\",\"The clinical course of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza can be severe, particularly in the very young and patients with comorbidities. Pandemic H1N1 2009 is sensitive to the antiviral agents oseltamivir and zanamivir but is resistant to the M2 inhibitors. Although few clinical data are yet available, treatment of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza in hospital settings with oseltamivir or zanamivir appears to be beneficial. In hospitalized patients with severe influenza treated with oseltamivir, mortality and length of stay are significantly reduced, and viral load is reduced more quickly than in untreated patients. In patients at high risk treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir, reductions in the risk of complications and mortality after treatment have been demonstrated with oseltamivir and zanamivir, although there are fewer data on the latter. There is no evidence yet that other antiviral agents are effective in severe or pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza. Current World Health Organization guidance strongly recommends the use of oseltamivir for severe or progressive infection with pandemic H1N1 2009, with zanamivir as an alternative if the infecting virus is oseltamivir-resistant. Very little resistance to oseltamivir has been found to date.\",\"Insulin resistance (IR) affects sustained virological response (SVR). The use of insulin-sensitizing agents has been proposed to improve therapy outcome. The safety and efficacy of pioglitazone on insulin sensitivity and SVR in treatment-na\\u00efve patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 4 with IR receiving standard antiviral therapy were evaluated in a randomized-controlled study.\",\"This randomized multicenter trial evaluated individualization of treatment duration with peginterferon alfa-2a 180 microg/wk plus ribavirin 1000/1200 mg/day in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1/4 based on the rapidity of virologic response (VR).\",\"Promising results have been observed with an investigational drug class for hepatitis C (HCV), the specifically targeted antiviral therapies for hepatitis C (STAT-Cs), when combined with peginterferon plus ribavirin (Peg-IFN/RBV). This class has the potential to increase sustained virological response (SVR) rates and reduce therapy duration in genotype 1 chronic HCV patients compared with Peg-IFN/RBV alone. However, because of the remarkable sequence variation in HCV (resulting from the high viral replication rate and intrinsically error-prone nature of HCV polymerase), variants with reduced susceptibility to STAT-Cs can occur naturally before treatment, usually at low levels, and can be selected in patients not responding to potent STAT-C treatment. This review first describes how resistance to a STAT-C can develop and then provides an overview of mutations that confer varying levels of resistance to STAT-Cs, which have been identified and characterized using both genotypic and phenotypic tools. We will discuss why an understanding of the selection of variants with reduced susceptibility to a treatment regimen may be important in optimizing the use of this new class of HCV therapy. Strategies for optimizing treatment regimens to increase response rates, and thereby minimize resistance, will be discussed. Finally, although resistance can be a consequence of not achieving an SVR on an initial regimen, there may be alternative treatment options for patients to achieve an SVR in the future. Future potential therapeutic strategies to address patients who do develop resistance to STAT-Cs are discussed, including combination therapy with multiple STAT-Cs with non-overlapping resistance profiles.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (CHC) infection is treated with interferon/ribavirin, but only a subset of patients respond. Treatment nonresponders have marked pretreatment up-regulation of a subset of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in their livers, including ISG15. We here study how the nonresponder gene expression phenotype is influenced by clinical factors and uncover the cellular basis of the phenotype through ISG15 protein expression.\",\"In this study we sought to characterize the relationship between several pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters and virologic responses among HIV/hepatitis C virus genotype-1 co-infected patients receiving pegylated interferon-alpha-2b (peg-IFN2b) and ribavirin. We also tried to establish the underlying mechanisms that lead to poor sustained virologic responder rates observed with African-Americans against Caucasians and compared their results with those observed in a cohort of hepatitis C virus mono-infected patients.\",\"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is overall recognised in 10% of HIV+ persons worldwide, with large differences according to geographical region. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects 25% of HIV+ individuals, with greater rates (approximately 75%) in intravenous drug users and persons infected through contaminated blood or blood products. HIV-hepatitis co-infected individuals show an accelerated course of liver disease, with faster progression to cirrhosis. The number of anti-HBV drugs has increased in the last few years, and some agents (e.g. lamivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir) also exert significant activity against HIV. Emergence of drug resistance challenges the long-term benefit of anti-HBV monotherapy, mainly with lamivudine. The results using new more potent anti-HBV drugs (e.g. tenofovir) are very promising, with prospects for stopping or even revert HBV-related liver damage in most cases. With respect to chronic hepatitis C, the combination of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin given for 1 year permits to achieve sustained HCV clearance in no more than 40% of HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Thus, new direct anti-HCV drugs are eagerly awaited for this population. Although being a minority, HIV+ patients with delta hepatitis and those with multiple hepatitis show the worst prognosis. Appropriate diagnosis and monitoring of chronic viral hepatitis, including the use of non-invasive tools for assessing liver fibrosis and measurement of viral load, may allow to confront adequately chronic viral hepatitis in HIV+ patients, preventing the development of end-stage liver disease, for which the only option available is liver transplantation. This article forms part of a special issue of Antiviral Research marking the 25th anniversary of antiretroviral drug discovery and development, Vol 85, issue 1, 2010.\",\"Insulin resistance (IR) reduces response to pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin in chronic hepatitis C (CHC), but the mechanisms are still undefined. We examined the relationship between baseline insulin levels, the main component affecting homeostasis model of assessment - insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) for assessment of IR in non-diabetic patients, and the 'acute' virological response to PEG-IFN measured 24 h after the first injection and taken as correlate of intracellular interferon signalling. In 62 patients treated with PEG-IFN/Ribavirin, serum insulin and HOMA-IR were assessed at baseline, while hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA was measured at baseline and 24 h, 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks after treatment initiation. Sustained virological response was examined 24 weeks after therapy discontinuation. Mean baseline insulin was 11.52 +/- 8.51 U/L and mean HOMA-IR was 2.65 +/- 2.01 both being significantly higher with advanced liver fibrosis. Hepatitis C virus-RNA decay observed 24 h after the first injection of PEG-IFN was significantly lower (0.7 +/- 0.8 log) in patients with HOMA > or =3 compared with those with HOMA <3 (1.7 +/- 0.8, P = 0.001). A highly significant (r = -0.42) inverse correlation was observed between baseline insulin levels and the 24-h HCV-RNA decay. The difference in early viral kinetics between patients with HOMA > or =3 or <3 resulted in a significant difference in the percentage of patients achieving rapid (week 4) and sustained virological response. Multivariate analysis, inclusive of patient age, HCV genotype and fibrosis stage, identified baseline insulin levels as the main independent variable affecting the 24-h response to PEG-IFN. Hyperinsulinaemia reduces the cellular response to Pegylated-interferon in CHC with IR. Strategies to reduce insulin levels before initiation of treatment should be pursued to improve efficacy of anti-viral treatment.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem, with over 170 million people infected worldwide. The current therapy, pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV), provides only approximately a 40% sustained virological response (undetectable HCV RNA for greater than 24 weeks after cessation of therapy), in genotype 1-infected individuals. In addition to the limited sustained virological response, PEG-IFN/RBV treatment is associated with serious adverse effects. Nucleosides have long been the cornerstone of antiviral therapy because of their proven efficacy and high barrier to resistance. Through the use of surrogate viruses or the HCV subgenomic replicon, several classes of nucleoside analogs or their monophosphate prodrugs have been identified that inhibit HCV RNA replication. Nucleoside analogs that possess the 2\\u00b4-C-methyl modification vary in their ability to be phosphorylated and to act as alternative substrate inhibitors of the HCV RNA polymerase. Herein, we discuss various classes of nucleoside inhibitors, with a focus on available structure-activity relationships, their mode of action and resistance profile.\",\"Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) expressed on natural killer and natural killer T cells are involved in activation of these cells and can influence antiviral immunity in the liver. This study investigated the association between KIR genetic diversity and sustained virologic response (SVR) to Peginterferon and Ribavirin (Peg/RBV) therapy in liver transplant (LT) recipients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence. We tested KIR genotypes in 44 HCV-infected LT recipients treated with Peg/RBV for 48 weeks. Patients were categorized as having KIR genotypes A/A or B/x and analyzed for association with SVR. Fifteen of 44 (34%) patients had SVR. Only 2 of 18 (11%) who lacked KIR2DS2/KIR2DL2 achieved SVR compared to 13 of 26 (50%) who carried these two genes (odds ratio: 8.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.5-42.0, P = 0.008). The association between lack of KIR2DS2/KIR2DL2 and SVR remained significant after exclusion of 10 patients with non-genotype 1 HCV. No correlation was found with other activating or inhibitory KIR genes. Absence of KIR2DS2 and/or KIR2DL2 is associated with failure of Peg/RBV therapy in patients with recurrent HCV after LT. These findings support the role of natural killer and natural killer T cells in HCV clearance after LT and might be generalizable to treatment of HCV infection outside the setting of LT.\",\"In the non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) of hepatitis C virus (HCV), mutations within the interferon sensitivity-determining region (ISDR), the PKR-binding domain (PKR-BD), the variable region 3 (V3), and the interferon/ribavirin resistance-determining region (IRRDR) have been correlated with the IFN-based therapy response. In Tunisia, where a high prevalence of HCV-1b has been found, no data regarding the implication of NS5A in treatment response were available. The current study examined the relationship between the pre-treatment mutation number within ISDR, PKR-BD, V3, IRRDR, as well as in the entire ISDR-V3 region of NS5A (aa 2209-2379) and the response to the 48-week course of combined IFN plus ribavirin therapy in 15 HCV-1b-infected Tunisian patients. Referring to HCV-J sequence, a significant high genetic variability was observed within PKR-BD in the sustained virological responder patients compared to non-responders (P = 0.040). More importantly, when considering the entire region from ISDR to V3, referred to as NS5A(ISDR-V3), a clear difference in the mutation number was observed between sustained virological responders (19.6 +/- 3.16) and non-responders (15.0 +/- 1.41) (P = 0.002). Additionally, a more detailed analysis of NS5A(ISDR-V3) region revealed an elevated degree of mutation rate within the region located between amino acids 2282 and 2308 (P = 0.0006). Interestingly, an analysis of specific amino acid variations defined proline and serine at position 2300 as signature patterns for sensitive and resistant strains, respectively. The genetic variability within the NS5A region of HCV-1b strains was associated with the response to the combined IFN plus ribavirin therapy in our Tunisian cohort.\",\"Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are frequently treated with a combination of pegylated interferon (peginterferon) and ribavirin. This study compared the efficacy and safety of peginterferon alfa-2a and peginterferon alfa-2b, each in combination with ribavirin.\",\"Insulin resistance affects sustained virological response (SVR) in chronic hepatitis C. To know whether adding metformin to standard antiviral treatment improves SVR, we conducted a prospective, multicentered, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 19 Spanish hospitals, including 123 consecutive patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C and insulin resistance. Patients were randomized to receive either metformin (arm A; n = 59) or placebo (arm B; n = 64) in addition to peginterferon alfa-2a (180 microg/week) and ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/day). The primary end point was SVR, and secondary endpoints were viral clearance at weeks 12, 24, and 48, and changes in the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index over the first 24 weeks. There were no differences between arms at baseline. In the intent-to-treat analysis, SVR was observed in 53% versus 42% in arm A and arm B, respectively (P = NS). In the subgroup analyses, SVR was higher in females (n = 54) receiving metformin: arm A, 58% (15/26) versus 29% (8/28) arm B (P = 0.03). In the per protocol analysis (PPA; n = 101), SVR was 67% in arm A and 49% in arm B (P = 0.06). Viral decline during the first 12 weeks was greater in females receiving metformin: -4.88 (1.18) versus -4.0 (1.44) (P = 0.021), whereas no differences were seen in males. The triple therapy was well tolerated, but diarrhea was more often seen in arm A (34% versus 11%; P < 0.05).\",\"Viral hepatitis poses important problems for children. In preschoolers, hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection frequently causes acute liver failure. Vaccinating toddlers against HAV in countries with high endemicity is expected to decrease mortality. HAV vaccine demonstrates efficacy (comparable to immunoglobulin) as post-exposure prophylaxis. A recently developed vaccine against hepatitis E virus (HEV) may benefit fetal health, because pregnant women are most prone to acute liver failure as a result of HEV. Hepatitis B vaccine continues to demonstrate value and versatility for preventing serious liver disease. With chronic infection, undetectable levels of serum HBV DNA complement e-seroconversion as the preferred outcome measure; suppressed viral load correlates with long-term complications better than HBeAg status. Among Taiwanese children, low pretreatment HBV DNA (<2 x 10(8) copies/ml) strongly predicted response to interferon-alpha. Future paediatric studies must incorporate HBV DNA levels. The rationale for routine treatment of immunotolerant hepatitis B during childhood remains uncertain. Any treatment of chronic hepatitis B in childhood requires consideration of the risks and benefits. Childhood hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection results mainly from mother-to-infant transmission. Babies of HCV-infected women should be tested for serum HCV RNA at 1 month of age. If negative, confirmatory anti-HCV antibody testing may be performed between 12 and 15 months of age. Children with chronic hepatitis C may develop progressive fibrosis/cirrhosis, particularly in the setting of obesity and insulin resistance. Treatment of children chronically infected with genotype 2 or 3 is highly successful: combination therapy of pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin is well tolerated and superior to pegylated interferon-alpha alone.\",\"The aim of this study was to assess the effect of insulin resistance (IR) on the response to hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients.\",\"Combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C is associated with depression, which may lead to worse treatment outcomes. The objectives of this study were to determine the association between patient characteristics and depression before and during treatment and to evaluate the relationship between depression and treatment outcomes.\",\"Boceprevir is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein (NS) 3/4A protease inhibitor that is currently being evaluated in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin in phase 3 studies. The clinical resistance profile of boceprevir is not characterized in detail so far. The NS3 protease domain of viral RNA was cloned from HCV genotype 1-infected patients (n = 22). A mean number of 47 clones were sequenced before, at the end, and after treatment with 400 mg boceprevir twice or three times daily for 14 days for genotypic, phenotypic, and viral fitness analysis. At the end of treatment, a wild-type an NS3 protease sequence was observed with a mean frequency of 85.9%. In the remaining isolates, five previously observed resistance mutations (V36M/A, T54A/S, R155K/T, A156S, V170A) and one mutation (V55A) with unknown resistance to boceprevir were detected either alone or in combination. Phenotypic analysis in the HCV replicon assay showed low (V36G, T54S, R155L; 3.8- to 5.5-fold 50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)]), medium (V55A, R155K, V170A, T54A, A156S; 6.8- to 17.7-fold IC(50)) and high level (A156T; >120-fold IC(50)) resistance to boceprevir. The overall frequency of resistant mutations and the level of resistance increased with greater declines in mean maximum HCV RNA levels. Two weeks after the end of treatment, the frequency of resistant variants declined and the number of wild-type isolates increased to 95.5%. With the exception of V36 and V170 variants all resistant mutations declined by more than 50%. Mathematical modeling revealed impaired replicative fitness for all single mutations, whereas for combined mutations a relative increase of replication efficiency was suggested.\",\"High serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels have been demonstrated to increase the probability of a sustained viral response (SVR) in chronic hepatitis C. Conversely, insulin resistance reduces SVR rates. We investigated the influence of baseline glucose and lipid values on the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment in HIV-1 infected subjects.\",\"Individualized treatment with a combination of peg-interferon and ribavirin for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been validated in randomized controlled clinical trials, but its usefulness in the real world is unknown. The aim of the present study was to assess the feasibility of individualized treatment for HCV patients compared with standard therapy in a real-life clinical setting.\",\"Ribavirin (RBV) combined with either pegylated interferon (PegIFN) alpha2a or PegIFNalpha2b is the standard of care for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Due to the lack of head-to-head studies, the 2 PegIFNs have not been directly compared. The endpoints of our study were safety and antiviral efficacy of the 2 regimens.\",\"Dramatic progress is being made toward the development of less-toxic and simpler alternatives to the current standard-of-care therapy for chronic hepatitis C, which involves a combination of pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). Several accessible viral targets have been identified and licensure of the most advanced clinical compounds can be anticipated within the next several years. However, the highly replicative nature of HCV infection, coupled with error-prone viral RNA synthesis and considerable genome diversity, pose extraordinary challenges to drug development. Peg-IFN is likely to remain a mainstay of therapy for the foreseeable future, or until such time that multiple direct-acting antiviral (STAT-C) inhibitors are available and shown to provide a sufficiently high barrier to resistance when used in combination.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects 3% of the world's population. Treatment of chronic HCV consists of a combination of PEGylated interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN-alpha) and ribavirin (RBV). To identify genetic variants associated with HCV treatment response, we conducted a genome-wide association study of sustained virological response (SVR) to PEG-IFN-alpha/RBV combination therapy in 293 Australian individuals with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C, with validation in an independent replication cohort consisting of 555 individuals. We report an association to SVR within the gene region encoding interleukin 28B (IL28B, also called IFNlambda3; rs8099917 combined P = 9.25 x 10(-9), OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.57-2.52). IL28B contributes to viral resistance and is known to be upregulated by interferons and by RNA virus infection. These data suggest that host genetics may be useful for the prediction of drug response, and they also support the investigation of the role of IL28B in the treatment of HCV and in other diseases treated with IFN-alpha.\",\"It is increasingly clear that a tailored therapeutic approach to patients with hepatitis C virus infection is needed. Success rates in difficult to treat and low-responsive hepatitis C virus patients are not completely satisfactory, and there is the need to optimise treatment duration and intensity in patients with the highest likelihood of response. In addition, the management of special patient categories originally excluded from phase III registration trials needs to be critically re-evaluated. This article reports the recommendations for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection on an individual basis, drafted by experts of three scientific societies.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease infecting more than 170 million people worldwide. HCV produces a wide gamut of manifestations varying from mild self-limiting disease to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A variety of viral, environmental and host genetic factors contribute to the clinical spectrum of patients infected with HCV and influence response to interferon (IFN) therapy. Predicting the probable outcome of treatment in patients with HCV infection has always been a challenging task. Treatment of HCV by pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) plus ribavirin eradicates the virus in approximately 60% of patients - HCV genotype 1 (42-51% response rates) and genotypes 2 and 3 (76-84% response rates); however, a significant number of patients do not respond to therapy or relapse following discontinuation of treatment or have significant side effects that preclude further treatment. Accurately predicting the patients who will respond to therapy is becoming increasingly important, both from the point of patient care and also with respect to the healthcare cost as clinicians need to continue treatment in patients who will respond and stop treatment in patients who are unlikely to respond. Viral RNA measurements and genotyping are used to optimize treatment as a low viral load and nongenotype 1 is more likely to be associated with sustained virological response (SVR). Rapid virological response (RVR) defined by undetectable HCV RNA at 4 weeks of treatment is increasingly being recognized as a powerful tool for predicting treatment response. A variety of host factors including single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) of IFN response genes, insulin resistance, obesity, ethnicity, human leukocyte antigens and difference in T-cell immune response has been found to modulate the response to antiviral treatment. The presence of severe fibrosis/cirrhosis on pretreatment liver biopsy predicts a poor response to treatment. Recent studies on gene expression profiling and characterization of the liver and serum proteome provide options to accurately predict the outcome of patients infected with HCV in the future. Future studies on the factors that predict treatment response and tailoring treatment based on this is required if we are to conquer this disease.\",\"The rapid decline in hepatitis C virus RNA is crucial for determining the outcome of therapy in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C. However, the variables influencing the early phase of viral decay are still largely unexplored. We aimed to assess which pre-treatment variable may predict rapid virologic response (RVR) and sustained virologic response (SVR).\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) quasispecies diversity is more likely to affect early viral decline during treatment of hepatitis C than is having human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We evaluated the influence of HCV therapy on changes in the nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4 (HCV-4) is increasing in prevalence in Western countries. However, little is known about the severity of the disease and response to treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the predictors (logistic regression) of severe fibrosis (METAVIR score F3-F4), and sustained virological response (SVR) to peginterferon and ribavirin in 226 consecutive HCV-4 patients (Egyptians 40%, Europeans 35% and Africans 24%).\",\"Patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) require significantly different durations of therapy and achieve substantially different sustained virologic response rates to interferon-based therapies, depending on the HCV genotype with which they are infected. There currently exists no systematic framework that explains these genotype-specific response rates. Since humans are the only known natural hosts for HCV-a virus that is at least hundreds of years old-one possibility is that over the time frame of this relationship, HCV accumulated adaptive mutations that confer increasing resistance to the human immune system. Given that interferon therapy functions by triggering an immune response, we hypothesized that clinical response rates are a reflection of viral evolutionary adaptations to the immune system.\",\"Investigating the evolution of the hepatitis C viral (HCV) genome in the small number of patients that experience viral breakthrough might shed light on the problem of resistance to interferon therapy. Within the HCV genome, sequence diversity of the viral nonstructural 5A protein-coding region (NS5A) has been linked to interferon responsiveness. We analysed the temporal sequence changes within NS5A in genotype 1a patients: 6 breakthrough (BT), 12 sustained virologic responders (SVR) and 12 non-responders (NR), all of whom had received full dose peg-interferon and ribavirin therapy. The entire NS5A region was amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR followed by direct sequencing of serum samples from baseline and three on-treatment time points for each group. Comparing baseline sequences with week 12 and later time points, BT patients resembled SVR patients in having a higher number of amino acid substitutions at week 12 than NR patients; however, the number of amino acid substitutions in this group decreased at and after BT. Substitutions were focused in the V3 and flanking regions in BT patients but not in SVR patients. The high number of substitutions in NS5A in both BT and SVR groups suggests that selective pressure is associated with viral response to therapy. Our results provide evidence that amino acid substitutions within the NS5A coding region may reflect a host response that drives selective pressure for viral adaptation.\",\"To report on the long-term followup of a cohort of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related vasculitis treated with rituximab with or without PEGylated interferon alfa-2b (PEG-IFN alfa-2b) plus ribavirin.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects approximately 4 million persons and is the major indication for liver transplantation in the United States. The current standard for treatment of HCV is pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin. Despite significant advances in treatment, only approximately 50% of patients of treated patients clear HCV infection. Polymerase inhibitors, given their potent antiviral effects, represent a major contribution to the future of HCV treatment. Whether these new drugs will have a role in the treatment of the difficult patient (non-responders, those co-infected with HIV, decompensated liver disease and liver transplant recipients) remains to be determined.\",\"Standard therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C is effective in 40% to 50% of individuals with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and is associated with significant treatment-related toxicities. Newly developed small molecules that target key enzymes essential for HCV replication are in development. Telaprevir, a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease, has shown great promise in early trials and is currently in advanced stages of clinical development. In treatment-na\\u00efve patients and those with previous treatment failure, the addition of telaprevir to standard interferon and ribavirin therapy is well tolerated and enhances rates of sustained virologic response while shortening the treatment duration. In this report, the current experience using telaprevir to treat chronic HCV infection as monotherapy and in combination with other agents is reviewed.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease leading to death from liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis C is the most common indication for liver transplantation worldwide and is a major cause of the increased incidence of hepatocellular cancer in the United States. The current paradigm for HCV treatment relies on pegylated interferon and ribavirin as agents that enhance endogenous mechanisms for viral clearance and are dependent on host factors. In patients with genotype 1 HCV infection, sustained viral response (SVR) rates remain suboptimal, with less than half of genotype 1-infected individuals going on to achieve SVR. This has led to a shift in the investigational focus for treatment of HCV toward specifically targeted antiviral therapy for HCV agents. This review focuses on boceprevir, a protease inhibitor, and discusses its mechanism of action, effects on HCV, and viral resistance.\",\"The current standard of care for treatment of hepatitis C is pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Despite the large number of new oral agents under development, interferon will likely remain the backbone of future therapy. Interferon has unique antiviral and immunomodulatory properties, which have been critical in limiting resistance to protease inhibitors and improving efficacy. Hence, optimizing pharmacokinetics and promoting adherence to interferon dosing regimens will become even more critical as new regimens enter the clinical arena. This review highlights novel interferons under development that may offer therapeutic advantages over the formulations currently available.\",\"Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) can suppress Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling by blocking an IFN-induced protein. In this study, the relationship between SOCS3 and phosphorylation of STAT1 in the liver and outcome of interferon therapy were examined.\",\"The recurring emergence of influenza virus strains that are resistant to available antiviral medications has become a global health concern, especially in light of the potential for a new influenza virus pandemic. Currently, virtually all circulating strains of influenza A virus in the United States are resistant to either of the two major classes of anti-influenza drugs (adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors). Thus, new therapeutic approaches that can be rapidly deployed and that will address the issue of recurring resistance should be developed. We have tested double and triple combinations of the approved anti-influenza drugs oseltamivir and amantadine together with ribavirin against three influenza virus strains using cytopathic effect inhibition assays in MDCK cells. We selected A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) and A/Sydney/05/97 (H3N2) as representatives of the wild-type versions of the predominant circulating seasonal influenza virus strains and A/Duck/MN/1525/81 (H5N1) as a representative of avian influenza virus strains. Dose-response curves were generated for all drug combinations, and the degree of drug interaction was quantified using a model that calculates the synergy (or antagonism) between the drugs in double and triple combinations. This report demonstrates that a triple combination of antivirals was highly synergistic against influenza A virus. Importantly, the synergy of the triple combination was 2- to 13-fold greater than the synergy of any double combination depending on the influenza virus subtype. These data support the investigation of a novel combination of oseltamivir, amantadine, and ribavirin as an effective treatment for both seasonal and pandemic influenza virus, allowing the efficient use of the existing drug supplies.\",\"In this study we evaluated the pharmacologic costs of hepatitis C treatment, considering recommendations on both the duration of therapy and sustained virological response. With this aim, we analyzed relevant scientific articles published in the previous 10 years, considering the most common genotypes present in Spain. In this analysis, we estimated overall costs to be 1,636,524.58-1,761,365.73 euro and 1,794.586.39-1,917,013.73 euro with the use of pegylated interferon (PegIFN)-alpha-2a and PegIFN-alpha-2b, respectively. Sustained virological response was 59.18% and 64.58% respectively, with no significant difference between the two formulations. Finally, we assess the economic costs of the use of high-dose PegIFN-alpha-2a and ribavirin in patients with genotype 1 and treatment resistance (baseline HCV-RNA values > 800.000UI/ml, without early viral response at 12 weeks and weight > 85kg).\",\"Analysis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA kinetics during antiviral therapy may allow estimation of the probability of response.\",\"Despite improvements to treatments for HCV infection, almost half of patients cannot be cured with standard combination therapy (pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin). The HCV life cycle offers a number of potential targets for molecular therapy, and several specifically targeted antiviral therapies for HCV (STAT-Cs) are in preclinical and clinical stages of development. Evidence to date suggests that monotherapy with any antiviral drug is unlikely to eradicate HCV infection. Combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin is necessary for the augmentation of antiviral drug activity and/or prevention of drug resistance. Results from clinical trials carried out in the past few years on STAT-C agents in combination with standard therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin provide great promise of higher rates of sustained virological response and, potentially, shorter duration of therapy than standard therapy alone achieves. Although pegylated interferon and ribavirin are likely to remain a cornerstone of therapeutic regimens in the short term, combinations of antiviral drugs of different classes, possibly along with novel agents that target host factors and modulate viral replication or augment antiviral defenses, offer the eventual possibility of interferon-free regimens.\",\"Treatment of chronic hepatitis C is currently based on a combination of pegylated interferon-o! and ribavirin. Neither drug exerts direct selective pressure on viral functions, meaning that interferon-a/ribavirin treatment failure is not due to selection of interferon-a- or ribavirin-resistant viral variants. Several novel antiviral approaches are currently in preclinical or clinical development, and most target viral enzymes and functions, such as hepatitis C virus protease and polymerase. These new drugs all potentially select resistant viral variants both in vitro and in vivo, and resistance is therefore likely to become an important issue in clinical practice.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents a global health problem due to its evolution to hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The viral pathogenesis and infectious processes are not yet fully understood. The development of natural viral resistance towards the host immune system represents a mayor challenge for the design of alternative therapeutic interventions and development of viral vaccines. The molecular mechanisms of hepatic fibrosis are well described. New alternatives for the treatment of patients with HCV infection and hepatic cirrhosis are under intensive research. New drugs such as viral protease inhibitors and assembly inhibitors, as well as immune modulators have been studied in clinical trials. Additional alternatives include antifibrotic drugs, which reverse the hepatic cellular damage caused by HCV infection. This review makes reference to viral infective mechanisms, molecular pathways of liver fibrosis and overviews conventional and new treatments for HCV infection and liver fibrosis.\",\"After the discovery of the hepatitis B virus in 1968 and of the hepatitis A virus in 1973, many years were needed to identify the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 1989. The discovery of HCV was a revolution for hepatology because of the magnitude of the global burden related to HCV infection, a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Therapy of hepatitis C has rapidly evolved with currently nearly 60% of sustained virological response with the combination of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. In patients with sustained virological response, viral eradication, corresponding to the cure of infection, and regression of histological liver lesions have been demonstrated. Recently, the availability of in vitro culture systems allowed to characterize viral enzymes, potential therapeutic targets. A novel therapeutic era is open with the protease and polymerase inhibitors, used as a first step in association with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, both to increase efficacy and decrease the risk of resistance. Thanks to these new molecules with a potent antiviral activity, one can reasonably predict a rapid improvement of treatments becoming more efficient and also better tolerated with the progressive replacement of interferon and ribavirin by combinations of these virus specific enzyme inhibitors.\",\"The recommended therapy for chronic hepatitis C, pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 24 or 48 weeks, has many known adverse side effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of antiviral therapy on male sexual health.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1b patients with high viral load are resistant to peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy, especially older and female patients.\",\"A 49-year-old white man presented to his primary-care clinic with fatigue and poor concentration. He had an enlarged liver with a minimally tender edge and was subsequently referred to our liver clinic.\",\"Approximately 3% of the worldwide population (i.e., more than 170 million people) are chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). An estimated 20% of these patients will develop liver cirrhosis within a mean of 20 years, and 2-5% of cirrhotic patients will die of end-stage liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma. The currently approved antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and ribavirin induces a sustained virological response (SVR) in 40-50% of patients infected with genotype 1, the most prevalent HCV type. In this review, we focus on the development and clinical application of serine protease inhibitors as anti-HCV agents. Although highly active in inducing a significant decline of serum HCV RNA, the rapid development of resistance must be counteracted in combination with other antiviral agents, currently pegIFN-alpha and ribavirin. Two serine protease inhibitors have reached clinical Phase III trials, increasing SVR rates and shortening treatment duration when combined with pegIFN and ribavirin. Trials of interferon-free targeted combination therapies are currently underway.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major health problem worldwide, infecting an estimated 170 million people. In this study, we have employed a large data set of sequences (14,654 sequences from between 25 and 100 clone sequences per analyzed region and per patient) from 67 patients infected with HCV genotype 1 (23 subtype 1a and 44 subtype 1b). For all patients, a sample prior to combined therapy with alpha interferon plus ribavirin was available, whereas for some patients additional samples after 6 or 12 months of treatment were also available. Twenty-seven patients responded to treatment (12 subtype 1a and 15 subtype 1b) and forty patients did not respond to treatment (11 subtype 1a vs. 29 subtype 1b). Two regions of the HCV genome were analyzed, one compressing the hypervariable regions (HVR1, HVR2 and HVR3) of the envelope 2 glycoprotein and another one including the interferon sensitive determining region (ISDR) and the V3 domain of the NS5A protein. Previously (Cuevas, J.M., Torres-Puente, M., Jim\\u00e9nez-Hern\\u00e1ndez, N., Bracho, M.A., Garc\\u00eda-Robles, I., Wrobel, B., Carnicer, F., del Olmo, J., Ortega, E., Moya, A., Gonz\\u00e1lez-Candelas, F., 2008b. Genetic variability of hepatitis C virus before and after combined therapy of interferon plus ribavirin. Plos One 3 (8), e3058), several amino acid positions in both regions analyzed were detected to be under positive selection. Here, we have compared the amino acid composition of each positively selected position between responder and non-responder patients for both subtypes. If we exclude some non-conclusive cases, no clear differences were detected in any case. In conclusion, identifying specific positions as completely discriminatory of treatment response seems to be a difficult task. Our results, in concordance with previous studies, suggest that HCV evasion strategies are more likely based on a global increased variability, which would yield combinations of mutations with an increased resistance, than on the fixation of specific amino acids conferring resistance to antiviral treatment or immune response. In this sense, the particular systemic response from each patient could play an essential role in determining the outcome of the antiviral treatment.\",\"Cyclic and periodic IFN treatment (CPIT) consisting of induction treatment with nIFN-beta followed by maintenance treatment with IFN-alpha could prevent viral breakthrough and achieve rapid virological response (RVR) and early virological response (EVR) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The efficacy and immune response of RBV+PEG-IFN-alpha2b using induction approach with CPIT (novel combination treatment: NCT) in 7 CHC patients with genotype 1b and high viral load were evaluated. A biometric multiplex serum cytokine assay was utilized to characterize the immunomodulatory effect. RVR and EVR were 7/7 and 7/7, respectively. Viral titers dropped below detectable levels in five patients with sustained virological response (SVR) before the end of CPIT (early virological responder: EAVR), and two patients without SVR after the end of CPIT (late virological responder: LAVR). At baseline, in EAVR compared with the controls, IL-6 and IL-15, CXCL-8 and CXCL-10 levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05); IL-10 and IL-13 levels were significantly lower (P < 0.05); and the IL-12 level was lower. In LAVR, GM-CSF, CXCL-8 and CXCL-10, and CCL-4 levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05); and IL-10 and IL-12 were lower than the controls. In EAVR but not LAVR, the IL-12 increased and the CCXL-8 decreased significantly (P < 0.05). In conclusion, NCT-induced viral clearance leading to improvement in the innate immune response resulting in SVR in CHC with genotype 1b and high viral load.\",\"Lethal mutagenesis, or virus extinction promoted by mutagen-induced elevation of mutation rates of viruses, may meet with the problem of selection of mutagen-resistant variants, as extensively documented for standard, non-mutagenic antiviral inhibitors. Previously, we characterized a mutant of foot-and-mouth disease virus that included in its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase replacement M296I that decreased the sensitivity of the virus to the mutagenic nucleoside analogue ribavirin.\",\"The amount of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a pivotal enzyme for the biosynthesis of the guanosine tri-phosphate (GTP), is frequently increased in tumor cells. The anti-viral agent ribavirin and the immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid (MPA) are potent inhibitors of IMPDH. We recently showed that IMPDH inhibition led to a necrotic signal requiring the activation of Cdc42.\",\"Half of the population of genotype 1 HCV is resistant to current pegylated-interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN-alpha) and ribavirin therapy. The resistance to IFN therapy is an urgent problem, especially in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection. However, sensitivities among HCV strains to anti-HCV reagents including IFNs have not been thoroughly addressed. Here, we established three different subgenomic replicons (1B-4, 1B-5, and KAH5 strains) in addition to our previously established replicon (O strain). We comparatively examined the sensitivities of four replicons to IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, IFN-lambda, cyclosporine A, and fluvastatin. Among the replicons, the 1B-4 and KAH5 replicons were the most sensitive and resistant, respectively to IFN-lambda (EC(50): 1.50 ng/ml vs. 8.50 ng/ml) and fluvastatin (EC(50): 2.82 microM vs. 7.87 microM), although these replicons possessed similar features in terms of genetic distance from the O strain, HCV RNA expression levels, and sensitivity to IFN-alpha (EC(50): 1.44 IU/ml vs. 1.37 IU/ml) and cyclosporine A (EC(50): 0.71 microg/ml vs. 0.96 microg/ml). These replicons are thus useful tools for examining the mechanism of anti-HCV activity, especially in IFN-lambda and statins.\",\"With an increasing worldwide burden of liver failure and liver cancer from chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, discovery and development efforts for new antiviral medicines for HCV are expanding rapidly. Two HCV protease inhibitors (PIs), telaprevir (VX950) and boceprevir (SCH503034), are now furthest along in clinical development, with Phase II data suggesting a potential treatment advance with triple combination regimens comprising a protease inhibitor, pegylated interferon and ribavirin. However, the current data suggest that such regimens will fail to produce sustained virologic responses in > or = 30 - 40% of patients, and tolerance of interferon/ribavirin treatment regimens is often problematic; hence, there is a need for continued development of new anti-HCV agents to further optimize treatment efficacy and safety. The HCV polymerase (HCV Pol) is an attractive target for antiviral therapy because the gene sequences encoding HCV Pol are relatively conserved across the six main HCV genotypes and the emergence of viral resistance is expected to be relatively slow for pharmaceutical agents, such as nucleoside analogues, that are targeted to the active (catalytic) site of HCV Pol.\",\"Treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with pegylated interferon/ribavirin achieves sustained virological response in up to 56% of HCV mono-infected patients and 40% of HCV/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-co-infected patients. The relationship of patient adherence to outcome warrants study.\",\"The present review is a concise review of recent developments in the field of viral hepatitis, based on publications between December 2007 and November 2008.\",\"Previous studies provided a direct experimental evidence for the contribution of HCV core protein in the development of insulin resistance (IR), but the clinical impact of HCV core region on IR is still not clear. The present study evaluated the impact of Amino acid (aa) substitutions of HCV-1b core region on IR in 123 Japanese patients infected with HCV-1b without cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus, and investigated the treatment efficacy of 48-week pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) according to HOMA-IR values. Patients with IR (HOMA-IR > or = 2.5) and severe IR (HOMA-IR > or = 3.5) were present in 51.2% and 27.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified body mass index (> or = 25 kg/m(2)) and hepatocyte steatosis (> or = 5%) as significant determinants of IR. Furthermore, multivariate analysis identified hepatocyte steatosis (> or = 5%), aa substitutions of the core region (Gln70 (His70) and/or Met91), and age (> or = 55 years) as significant determinants of severe IR. Especially, significantly lower proportions of patients with Gln70 (His70) and/or Met91 were noted among those without severe IR (59.6%) than those with severe IR (82.4%). The rates of sustained virological response in patients with IR (50.0%) were not significantly different from those without IR (52.9%). Furthermore, the rates of non-virological response in patients with IR (28.9%) were not significantly also different from those without IR (20.6%). In conclusion, the present study indicated that substitutions of HCV-1b core region were the important predictor of severe IR in patients without cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus, but HOMA-IR values might be not useful as predictors of 48-week PEG-IFN plus RBV therapy.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma and end-stage liver disease. The current FDA-approved treatment for HCV (pegylated interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) with ribavirin) is effective in only about 50% of patients. Epidemiological evidence suggests that obesity, alcohol, smoking, and environmental pollutants may contribute to resistance to IFNalpha therapy in HCV. Acrolein, a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and major component of cigarette smoke, is also generated endogenously by cellular metabolism and lipid peroxidation. This study examines the effects of acrolein on (i) IFNalpha-mediated signaling and antiviral gene expression in cultured and primary human hepatocytes and (ii) HCV replication in an HCV-replicon system. Our data demonstrate that nontoxic concentrations of acrolein significantly inhibited IFNalpha-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both cytoplasmic and nuclear STAT1 and STAT2, without altering the total levels. Also, acrolein down-regulated IFNalpha-stimulated gene transcription, resulting in reduced expression of antiviral genes. Importantly, acrolein abolished the IFNalpha-mediated down-regulation of HCV viral expression in the HCV-replicon system. This study defines mechanisms involved in resistance to IFNalpha and identifies the pathogenic role of acrolein, and potentially other environmental pollutants, in suppressing IFNalpha antiviral activity and establishes their adverse impact on HCV therapy.\",\"Albinterferon-alpha-2b (albIFN) is a long-acting fusion polypeptide composed of albumin and IFN-alpha-2b. In a phase 2 study of albIFN 1500 mug q2wk or q4wk in patients with genotype 2/3 chronic hepatitis C, albIFN demonstrated sustained virological response (SVR) rates of 62-77% (intent-to-treat population).\",\"Early changes in hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels were assessed in a large cohort of African American and white patients with chronic hepatitis C due to HCV genotype 1 who underwent therapy with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin in the Study of Viral Resistance to Antiviral Therapy of Hepatitis C (Virahep-C). Analyses were restricted to 341 patients who completed the first 28 days of therapy without dose modification. HCV RNA levels decreased in virtually all patients, but the amount of the change varied markedly. The overall 28-day decrease in HCV RNA levels was at least as predictive of a sustained virological response as the first- or second-phase viral kinetics responses. Factors associated with a smaller decrease in the HCV RNA level between baseline and day 28 included African American race, higher initial HCV RNA level, more severe hepatic fibrosis, and higher body weight. African American patients with similar 28-day decreases in viral levels as white patients were still less likely to achieve a sustained virological response. These results suggest that racial differences in the response to antiviral therapy are due to greater unresponsiveness to intracellular actions of interferon in African American individuals and that standard doses of peginterferon and ribavirin may be suboptimal for patients with higher body weights. Trial registration. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00038974 .\",\"An amantadine-resistant influenza A/Duck/MN/1525/81 (H5N1) virus was developed from the low-pathogenic North American wild-type (amantadine-sensitive) virus for studying treatment of infections in cell culture and in mice. Double combinations of amantadine, oseltamivir (or the cell culture-active form, oseltamivir carboxylate), and ribavirin were used. Amantadine-oseltamivir carboxylate and amantadine-ribavirin combinations showed synergistic interactions over a range of doses against wild-type virus in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell culture, but oseltamivir carboxylate-ribavirin combinations did not. Primarily additive interactions were seen with oseltamivir carboxylate-ribavirin combinations against amantadine-resistant virus. The presence of amantadine in drug combinations against the resistant virus did not improve activity. The wild-type and amantadine-resistant viruses were lethal to mice by intranasal instillation. The resistant virus infection could not be treated with amantadine up to 100 mg/kg body weight/day, whereas the wild-type virus infection was treatable with oral doses of 10 (weakly effective) to 100 mg/kg/day administered twice a day for 5 days starting 4 h prior to virus exposure. Drug combination studies showed that treatment of the amantadine-resistant virus infection with amantadine-oseltamivir or amantadine-ribavirin combinations was not significantly better than using oseltamivir or ribavirin alone. In contrast, the oseltamivir-ribavirin (25- and 75-mg/kg/day combination) treatments produced significant reductions in mortality. The wild-type virus infection was markedly reduced in severity by all three combinations (amantadine, 10 mg/kg/day combined with the other compounds at 20 or 40 mg/kg/day) compared to monotherapy with the three compounds. Results indicate a lack of benefit of amantadine in combinations against amantadine-resistant virus, but positive benefits in combinations against amantadine-sensitive virus.\",\"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) play a critical role in antiviral defense. To better understand pegylated interferon (IFN)-alpha and ribavirin combination therapy resistance, we examined the STAT expression in the liver.\",\"Treatment for hepatitis C virus infection currently consists of pegylated interferon and ribavirin (RBV), a nucleoside analog. Although RBV clearly plays a role in aiding the treatment response, its antiviral mechanism is unclear. Regardless of the specific mechanism of RBV, we hypothesize that differences in levels of cellular uptake of RBV may affect antiviral efficacy and treatment success and that cells may become RBV resistant through reduced uptake. We monitored RBV uptake in various cell lines and determined the effect of uptake capacity on viral replication. RBV-resistant cells demonstrated reduced RBV uptake and increased growth of a model RNA virus, poliovirus, in the presence of RBV. Overexpression of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) or concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 (CNT3) increased RBV uptake in RBV-sensitive cell lines and restored the uptake defect in most RBV-resistant cell lines. However, CNT3 is not expressed in Huh-7 liver cells, and inhibition of concentrative transport did not affect RBV uptake. Blocking equilibrative transport using the inhibitor nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside recapitulated the RBV-resistant phenotype in RBV-sensitive cell lines, with a reduction in RBV uptake and increased poliovirus growth. Taken together, these results indicate that RBV uptake is restricted primarily to ENT1 in the cell lines examined. Interestingly, some RBV-resistant cell lines may compensate for reduced ENT1-mediated nucleoside uptake by increasing the activity of an alternative nucleoside transporter, ENT2. It is possible that RBV uptake affects the antiviral treatment response, either through natural differences in patients or through acquired resistance.\",\"Debio 025 is a cyclophilin (Cyp) inhibitor without calcineurin-binding properties. The drug inhibits viral replication of genotype 1b and 2a replicons in nanomolar concentrations and shows an additive to synergistic antiviral effect with interferon, ribavirin, and specifically targeted antiviral therapy for hepatitis C (STAT-C) drugs. There is no cross-resistance with protease and polymerase inhibitors. In humans, Debio 025 has shown activity against genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4, and displays an additive antiviral effect with pegylated interferon (peg-IFN)alpha2a in genotype 1 and 4 patients. The most prominent side effect is reversible hyperbilirubinaemia caused by inhibition of biliary transporters. Debio 025 is a potent anti-HCV drug, with a novel mechanism of action and an efficacy profile that makes it an attractive candidate for combination with current and future HCV treatments.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) presents several regions involved potentially in evading antiviral treatment and host immune system. Two regions, known as PKR-BD and V3 domains, have been proposed to be involved in resistance to interferon. Additionally, hypervariable regions in the envelope E2 glycoprotein are also good candidates to participate in evasion from the immune system. In this study, we have used a cohort of 22 non-responder patients to combined therapy (interferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin) for which samples obtained just before initiation of therapy and after 6 or/and 12 months of treatment were available. A range of 25-100 clones per patient, genome region and time sample were obtained. The predominant amino acid sequences for each time sample and patient were determined. Next, the sequences of the PKR-BD and V3 domains and the hypervariable regions from different time samples were compared for each patient. The highest levels of variability were detected at the three hypervariable regions of the E2 protein and, to a lower extent, at the V3 domain of the NS5A protein. However, no clear patterns of adaptation to the host immune system or to antiviral treatment were detected. In summary, although high levels of variability are correlated to viral adaptive response, antiviral treatment does not seem to promote convergent adaptive changes. Consequently, other regions must be involved in evasion strategies likely based on a combination of multiple mechanisms, in which pools of changes along the HCV genome could confer viruses the ability to overcome strong selective pressures.\",\"Insulin resistance (IR) might be associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This study aimed to elucidate impact of IR and beta-cell function on the response to peginterferon-alpha (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin combination therapy in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients.\",\"To evaluate the possible influence of baseline insulin resistance in sustained virological response.\",\"The natural history of chronic hepatitis C has been defined in several retrospective and prospective studies conducted in the last 20 years. These studies have clearly demonstrated that the outcome of chronic hepatitis C virus infection is profoundly influenced by a variety of cofactors and comorbidities. Many of the cofactors that affect the course of liver disease in hepatitis C also have a significant influence on the result of antiviral therapy. Unfortunately, comorbidities that have been shown to negatively influence the course and outcome of liver disease often reduce the chance of achieving a sustained virological response with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin treatment. The most important and frequent comorbidity influencing the course of chronic hepatitis C and the response to antiviral therapy is represented by the metabolic syndrome, and by the associated state of insulin resistance. Other comorbidities that have a negative influence on the progression of hepatitis C and on the response to antiviral therapy include excess alcohol intake, human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus co-infection and a number of conditions that reduce the benefit of therapy by affecting negatively compliance and/or adherence to adequate PEG-IFN or ribavirin doses.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a serious health problem worldwide. The current standard treatment of HCV infection is pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin, but this is clearly not sufficiently effective and tolerable.\",\"Specifically Targeted Antiviral Therapy against hepatitis C virus (STAT-C) stands for a new era in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Results from recent trials with protease and polymerase inhibitors indicate that therapy with a single HCV specific compound will not be sufficient to eradicate hepatitis C virus infection and that combination therapy will be necessary to improve sustained virologic response rates. The search for the optimal combination of STAT-C compounds with peginterferon alfa with or without ribavirin is currently under investigation in several clinical trials. Overall the current studies indicate that peginterferon alfa and ribavirin remain the backbone of antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis C even in the era of STAT-C. Nevertheless, it can be anticipated that combination of STAT-C compounds with non-overlapping resistance profiles could improve response to antiviral therapy. Promising combinations are protease inhibitors plus nucleoside analogue and non-nucleoside analogue polymerase inhibitors.\",\"Insulin resistance is a candidate predictive factor for virological response to peginterferon plus ribavirin (PEG/RBV) therapy in chronic hepatitis C patients. We examined whether indices of insulin resistance could serve as a predictor of sustained virological response (SVR). Fifty-one patients with genotype 1b and high viral load who received PEG/RBV therapy for 48 weeks were included. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and whole-body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI) calculated from the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and serum levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (sTFNR2) were evaluated before therapy. Patients who achieved SVR had significantly lower HOMA-IR and sTNFR2 levels and a higher WBISI compared with non-SVR patients. The positive predictive value for SVR was 0.653 for a HOMA-IR of <2 and 0.846 for a WBISI of 6 or higher. WBISI may serve as a highly specific predictor for SVR in PEG/RBV therapy.\",\"The need for effective treatment for chronic hepatitis C infection has driven the development of novel antiviral agents that target specific steps in the viral replication cycle.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major and growing global health problem, affecting about 170 million people worldwide, and is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, treatment is restricted to interferon alfa and ribavirin, which leads to a successful outcome in only about 50% of individuals. New effective treatments with tolerable side-effect profiles are needed urgently, but development has been hindered by an inability to culture HCV and a scarcity of animal models. Herein, we review progress in HCV biology, including cell culture and new animal models, and the contribution of this work to our understanding of the virus' life-cycle and pathogenesis and development of specifically targeted antiviral treatment. We also discuss changes in our understanding of HCV epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostics.\",\"Insulin resistance may promote hepatic fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C (HCV) and has emerged as a cofactor in failure to achieve sustained viral response (SVR).\",\"Influenza pneumonia causes high mortality every year, and pandemic episodes kill millions of people. Influenza-related mortality has been variously ascribed to an ineffective host response that fails to limit viral replication, an excessive host inflammatory response that results in lung injury and impairment of gas exchange, or to bacterial superinfection. We sought to determine whether lung inflammation promoted or impaired host survival in influenza pneumonia.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a global health threat with approximately 175 million carriers worldwide. Currently, treatment consists of pegylated interferon alpha plus ribavirin for 12-72 weeks, depending on HCV genotype, baseline viral load, and initial virological response to therapy. Serious adverse effects and limited sustained virological responses with this therapy warrant the need for novel HCV therapies. Specifically targeted antiviral therapies designed to inhibit the HCV serine protease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase have recently entered clinical development. Herein, the main characteristics of these new antiviral agents and the most important challenges arising with their use--namely, toxicities and rapid selection of resistance--are discussed.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common RNA virus that causes hepatitis and liver cancer. Infection is treated with IFN-alpha and ribavirin, but this expensive and physically demanding therapy fails in half of patients. The genomic sequences of independent HCV isolates differ by approximately 10%, but the effects of this variation on the response to therapy are unknown. To address this question, we analyzed amino acid covariance within the full viral coding region of pretherapy HCV sequences from 94 participants in the Viral Resistance to Antiviral Therapy of Chronic Hepatitis C (Virahep-C) clinical study. Covarying positions were common and linked together into networks that differed by response to therapy. There were 3-fold more hydrophobic amino acid pairs in HCV from nonresponding patients, and these hydrophobic interactions were predicted to contribute to failure of therapy by stabilizing viral protein complexes. Using our analysis to detect patterns within the networks, we could predict the outcome of therapy with greater than 95% coverage and 100% accuracy, raising the possibility of a prognostic test to reduce therapeutic failures. Furthermore, the hub positions in the networks are attractive antiviral targets because of their genetic linkage with many other positions that we predict would suppress evolution of resistant variants. Finally, covariance network analysis could be applicable to any virus with sufficient genetic variation, including most human RNA viruses.\",\"Debio 025 is a potent inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication (J. Paeshuyse et al., Hepatology 43:761-770, 2006). In phase I clinical studies, monotherapy (a Debio 025 dose of 1,200 mg twice a day) resulted in a mean maximal decrease in the viral load of 3.6 log(10) units (R. Flisiak et al., Hepatology 47:817-826, 2008), whereas a reduction of 4.6 log(10) units was obtained in phase II studies when Debio 025 was combined with interferon (R. Flisiak et al., J. Hepatol., 48:S62, 2008). We here report on the particular characteristics of the in vitro anti-HCV activities of Debio 025. The combination of Debio 025 with either ribavirin or specifically targeted antiviral therapy for HCV (STAT-C) inhibitors (NS3 protease or NS5B [nucleoside and nonnucleoside] polymerase inhibitors) resulted in additive antiviral activity in short-term antiviral assays. Debio 025 has the unique ability to clear hepatoma cells from their HCV replicon when it is used alone or in combination with interferon and STAT-C inhibitors. Debio 025, when it was used at concentrations that have been observed in human plasma (0.1 or 0.5 muM), was able to delay or prevent the development of resistance to HCV protease inhibitors as well as to nucleoside and nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitors. Debio 025 forms an attractive drug candidate for the treatment of HCV infections in combination with standard interferon-based treatment and treatments that directly target the HCV polymerase and/or protease.\",\"Hypokalaemic thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is an enigmatic and uncommon condition which occurs exclusively in males of Asian descent. The underlying causes of thyrotoxicosis may be any of the well-recognized etiologies including a toxic multinodular goiter, Graves' disease or iodine excess. Beside thyrotoxicosis, a number of other hormonal factors have been hypothesized to contribute to hypokalaemic thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, particularly postprandial hyperinsulinaemia and testosterone. We hereby present a case of a 48-year-old hepatitis C positive gender-assigned man in whom all of these factors are proposed to interact, lending further support to these hypotheses. The patient presented with interferon-induced thyroiditis causing acute generalized weakness whilst undergoing combination interferon-alpha-2beta and ribavirin therapy. As part of his hepatitis C infection, marked insulin resistance with hyperinsulinaemia was also present, exacerbating the paresis. Initial treatment with beta-blocker failed to normalize his serum potassium concentration, requiring the novel use of spironolactone, despite euthyroidism. This continued to be required until his testosterone supplement dissipated.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has evolved remarkable mechanisms that favor viral persistence by interfering with host innate and adaptive immune responses. These same mechanisms are likely to contribute to resistance to exogenously administered interferon used for HCV treatment. We review the host innate and adaptive immune responses in the context of HCV infection as well as the strategies by which these responses are subverted by the virus. In addition, the contribution of host factors, such as race and insulin resistance, to interferon non-responsiveness is discussed. Our progress in understanding the molecular underpinnings of interferon treatment failure in HCV infection has resulted in several promising and novel treatment strategies for HCV treatment non-responders.\",\"Antiviral agents for the treatment of influenza are urgently needed to circumvent the limitations of current drugs in several critical areas: high frequencies of resistance to M2 inhibitors among currently circulating strains and variable frequencies of resistance to oseltamivir among A(H1N1) strains, limited efficacy of treatment and treatment-emergent antiviral resistance in cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) illness in humans, and lack of parenteral agents for seriously ill patients. Two neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), zanamivir and peramivir, have undergone or are undergoing clinical trials for use by intravenous or intramuscular administration, and one long-acting NAI, designated CS-8958, is under study for use by inhalation. Advances in understanding the mechanisms involved in influenza virus replication have revealed a number of potential targets that might be exploited in the development of new agents. Among these agents are T-705, a polymerase inhibitor, and DAS181, an attachment inhibitor. Combination therapy with currently available agents is supported by data from animal models but has received limited clinical study to date.\",\"The majority of patients with chronic hepatitis C fail to respond to antiviral therapy. The genetic basis of this resistance is unknown. The quasispecies nature of HCV may have an important implication concerning viral persistence and response to therapy. The HCV nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein has been controversially implicated in the inherent resistance of HCV to interferon (IFN) antiviral therapy. To evaluate whether the NS5A quasispecies pre-treatment composition of HCV 1a/1b is related to responsiveness to combined pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and Ribavirin therapy, detailed analyses of the complete NS5A were performed. Fifteen full-length NS5A clones were sequenced from 11 pre-treatment samples of patients infected with genotype 1 HCV (3 virological sustained responders, 4 non-responders, and 4 end-of-treatment responders). Our study could not show a significant correlation between the mean number of mutations in HCV NS5A before treatment and treatment outcome, and the phylogenetic construction of complete NS5A sequences obtained from all patients failed to show any clustering associated with a specific response pattern. No single amino acid position was associated with different responses to therapy in any of the NS5A regions analyzed, and mutations were clustered downstream the ISDR, primarily in the V3 region. We observed that the CRS and NLS regions of the NS5A protein were conflicting for some variables analyzed, although no significant differences were found. If these two regions can have antagonistic functions, it seems viable that they present different mutation profiles when compared with treatment response. The patient sample that presented the lowest genetic distance values also presented the smallest number of variants, and the most heterogeneous pattern was seen in the end-of-treatment patients. These results suggest that a detailed molecular analysis of the NS5A region on a larger sample size may be necessary for understanding its role in the therapy outcome of HCV 1a/1b infection.\",\"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are a major threat worldwide. Combination therapy of interferon-alpha and ribavirin is currently the treatment of choice for HCV-infected patients. However, this regimen is only effective in approximately 50% of patients and provokes severe side-effects. Numerous natural alternatives for treating HCV have been suggested. Deoxynojirimycin and its derivatives are iminosugars which exert anti-HCV activity by inhibiting alpha-glucosidases. A non-immunosuppressive derivate of cyclosporine A, NIM811, exerts anti-HCV activity by binding to cyclophilin. Other natural products with promising anti-HCV activity are 2-arylbenzofuran derivatives, Mellein, and pseudoguaianolides. For HBV treatment, several drugs are available, specifically targeting the virus polymerase (lamivudine, entecavir, telbivudine, and adefovir dipivoxil). The efficacy of these drugs is hampered by the development of resistance due to point mutations in the HBV polymerase. Due to drug resistance and adverse side-effects, the search for novel drugs is mandatory. Wogonin, ellagic acid, artemisinin and artesunate, chrysophanol 8-O-beta-D-glucoside, saikosaponin C, and protostane triterpenes are active against HBV. Natural products need to be investigated in more detail to explore their potential as novel adjuncts to established HBV or HCV therapy.\",\"The importance of metabolic disorders in the pathophysiology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections is becoming increasingly apparent. Metabolic anomalies, with their potential for multiple-organ involvement, are to be expected, given the chronic nature of these diseases, and the intracellular dysregulation associated with them. Not only have the endocrine and cytokine metabolic anomalies seen in HIV and HCV infections been linked with the metabolic syndrome, but they also appear to have some pathways in common. Studying the differences and similarities between these metabolic anomalies may add to our understanding of HIV and HCV infection, and provide guidance on how to treat these chronic diseases. This review highlights the principal underlying factors for metabolic disorders in these chronic viral diseases-namely insulin resistance and liver damage. Both the chronic viral state itself and the host immune response give rise to glucose and lipid metabolic disorders that, in turn, are risk factors for hepatic damage. The various interactions between HIV and/or HCV with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, steatosis and fibrogenesis should be considered when determining the treatment and long-term follow-up of patients. Recent data indicate that HCV clearance improves insulin resistance and hepatic function in HCV-infected patients treated with interferon with or without ribavirin.\",\"Resistance mutations to hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) protease inhibitors in <1% of the viral quasispecies may still allow >1000-fold viral load reductions upon treatment, consistent with their reported reduced replicative fitness in vitro. Recently, however, an R155K protease mutation was reported as the dominant quasispecies in a treatment-na\\u00efve individual, raising concerns about possible full drug resistance. To investigate the prevalence of dominant resistance mutations against specifically targeted antiviral therapy for HCV (STAT-C) in the population, we analyzed HCV genome sequences from 507 treatment-na\\u00efve patients infected with HCV genotype 1 from the United States, Germany, and Switzerland. Phylogenetic sequence analysis and viral load data were used to identify the possible spread of replication-competent, drug-resistant viral strains in the population and to infer the consequences of these mutations upon viral replication in vivo. Mutations described to confer resistance to the protease inhibitors Telaprevir, BILN2061, ITMN-191, SCH6 and Boceprevir; the NS5B polymerase inhibitor AG-021541; and to the NS4A antagonist ACH-806 were observed mostly as sporadic, unrelated cases, at frequencies between 0.3% and 2.8% in the population, including two patients with possible multidrug resistance. Collectively, however, 8.6% of the patients infected with genotype 1a and 1.4% of those infected with genotype 1b carried at least one dominant resistance mutation. Viral loads were high in the majority of these patients, suggesting that drug-resistant viral strains might achieve replication levels comparable to nonresistant viruses in vivo.\",\"Interferon-alpha induces 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase which activates RNase L. Viral RNA is cleaved by RNase L at UU/UA dinucleotides. The clinical relevance of RNase L cleavage for response to an interferon-alpha-based therapy in chronic hepatitis C is unknown.\",\"Overweight/obesity is an independent negative predictive factor of steatosis in chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The nonresponse to combined peginterferon and ribavirin treatment in infection caused by genotype 1 is associated with the waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, steatosis, and degree of fibrosis. The obesity is an independent negative predictive factor of inefficacy of antiviral treatment.\",\"The dynamics of the viral decline immediately after the start of therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may have prognostic potential for ultimate sustained virologic response. Considerable interindividual variability in the decline has been reported, including differences by race. The human major histocompatability complex (MHC) genes encode the human leukocyte antigens, which are important in the immune response to viral infections. We examined whether carriage of specific human MHC alleles are associated with the rate of the early viral decline. Longitudinal viral level data (baseline and days 1, 2, 7, 14, and 28 of treatment), medium resolution MHC genotyping, and random coefficients models were used to examine associations between MHC class I and class II allele carriage and the dynamics of the viral decline in 180 African-Americans (AAs) and 194 Caucasian Americans (CAs) with genotype-1 HCV infection over the first 28 days of treatment with peginterferon alpha2a plus ribavirin. Baseline viral levels were similar by race, irrespective of allele carriage. However, the rate of change in the viral decline was associated with both allele and race. Among the four subgroups defined by race and specific allele, the fastest rates of decline were observed (in terms of estimated mean viral declines log(10) IU/ml during the first four weeks) in CA noncarriers for A*03 (2.75; P = 0.018), in CA carriers for Cw*03 (2.99; P = 0.046), and in CA noncarriers for DQA1*04 (2.66; P = 0.018) or DQB1*0402 (2.65; P = 0.018). MHC alleles are associated with the viral decline during the first 28 days of peginterferon therapy.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a pressing medical problem worldwide. Current therapy with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (Peg-IFN/RBV) is associated with a poor risk benefit profile, a long treatment duration (48 weeks) and inadequate success rate (approximately 40-50%) of SVR (sustained viral response) in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. This review is focused on recent clinical trial results with specifically targeted antiviral therapy for HCV (STAT-C) protease and polymerase inhibitors. In the past decade, anti-HCV drug discovery has focused first on targeting host factors required for viral replication and second on multiple HCV antiviral agents. Owing to the large number of HCV inhibitors currently in pre-clinical and clinical development today, we have focused on the most advanced compounds in the HCV polymerase and HCV protease inhibitor classes. Within each class, compounds will be used to illustrate some of the properties associated with inhibitors that bind to the active site of HCV polymerase, the active site of HCV protease (macrocyclic and linear ketoamide inhibitors) and allosteric polymerase inhibitors.\",\"The emergence of influenza strains that are resistant to commonly used antivirals has highlighted the need to develop new compounds that target viral gene products or host mechanisms that are essential for effective virus replication. Existing assays to identify potential antiviral compounds often use high throughput screening assays that target specific viral replication steps. To broaden the search for antivirals, cell-based replication assays can be performed, but these are often labor intensive and have limited throughput.\",\"Oral Silibinin (SIL) is widely used for treatment of hepatitis C, but its efficacy is unclear. Substantially higher doses can be administered intravenously (IV).\",\"Treatment predictors are important tools for the management of therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C virus (HBV, HCV) infection. In chronic hepatitis B, several pretreatment parameters have been identified for prediction of virologic response to interferon alfa-based antiviral therapies or treatment with polymerase inhibitors. In interferon alfa and pegylated interferon alfa-treated patients, low baseline HBV DNA concentrations, HBV genotype A (B), and high baseline ALT levels are significantly associated with treatment response. In patients treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues, low baseline HBV DNA but not viral genotype is positively associated with virologic response. During treatment the best predictor of response is HBV DNA kinetics. Early viral suppression is associated with favourable virologic response and reduced risk for subsequent resistance mutations. For the current standard treatment with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C, infection with HCV genotypes 2 and 3, baseline viral load below 400,000-800,000 IU/ml, Asian and Caucasian ethnicity, younger age, low GGT levels, absence of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, and absence of steatosis in the liver have been identified as independent pretreatment predictors of a sustained virologic response. After initiation of treatment, initial viral decline with undetectable HCV-RNA at week 4 of therapy (RVR) is the best predictor of sustained virologic response independent of HCV genotype.\",\"Nitazoxanide and its primary metabolite, tizoxanide, inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in HCV replicon systems. To study the potential for resistance, we subjected Huh7 cells harboring HCV replicons to serial passage in 250 muM G418 and increasing concentrations of nitazoxanide or tizoxanide. Passage of the replicon-containing cell lines in either compound resulted in increases in the 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) (7- to 13-fold), EC(90)s (14- to 36-fold), and 50% cytotoxic concentrations (2- to 4-fold) of both compounds. Serial passage in either compound did not alter the susceptibility of HCV replicons to ribavirin or 2'-C-methylcytidine. Interestingly, serial passage in nitazoxanide or tizoxanide resulted in increased sensitivity to alpha interferon 2b: EC(50)s and EC(90)s were reduced three- and eightfold, respectively. Replicons isolated from these cell lines had no greater ability to confer tizoxanide resistance, or increased susceptibility to alpha interferon, than replicons isolated from the parental cell line that had not previously been exposed to nitazoxanide or tizoxanide. These findings are indicative of a cell-mediated activity differing from that of other anti-HCV drugs but complementary with interferon and are consistent with the enhanced response rates observed clinically when nitazoxanide is combined with pegylated interferon therapy. Finally, unlike data for other compounds in advanced clinical development for HCV, these data are consistent with resistance in HCV replicon-containing cell lines conferred by changes in the host and not by mutations in the virus.\",\"Patients with chronic hepatitis C are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and this risk may increase among hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients not responding to an antiviral therapy.\",\"Cross-sectional studies suggest insulin resistance is strongly associated with hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), which might affect the efficacy of antiviral therapy. Aim To investigate retrospectively the impact of insulin resistance on treatment response in Chinese genotype 1 CHC patients receiving a 24-week course therapy with peginterferon alpha-2b/ribavirin.\",\"After a treatment by peginterferon alpha and ribavirin, the percentages of non response and relapse are approximatively 33 and 18 % respectively. These treatment failures may be due either to viral resistance or to an insufficient treatment. The prevention of treatment failure is based on a good knowledge of the predictive factors of failure before and during the treatment. Among the patients who did not respond to interferon alpha and ribavirin, a new treatment with peginterferon alpha-2b and ribavirin makes it possible to obtain 45 % of sustained virological response (SVR) among the relapsers and 17 % of SVR among the non responders. Among the patients who did not respond to peginterferon alpha and ribavirin, a new treatment with peginterferon alpha-2b and ribavirin makes it possible to obtain 36 % of SVR among the relapsers and only 4 % of SVR among the non responders. New therapeutic strategies are necessary for the non responders. Until now no new therapeutic strategy allowed a significant benefit in term of SVR. Protease inhibitors are currently tested in non responders but there are some concerns about the risk of selection of multi-resistant strains.\",\"The prevalence and clinical implications of naturally occurring variants that are resistant to hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors in treatment-naive patients has not been reported. We report here the prevalence of such variants and their effect on clinical response.\",\"Insulin resistance is extremely common and frequently is associated with comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, infertility, and neurodegeneration. In addition, insulin resistance is the driving force for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Interestingly, co-existence of insulin resistance and chronic hepatitis C occurs more often than predicted by chance, with recent estimates indicating that 30% to 70% of patients with chronic hepatitis C display some evidence of insulin resistance. Recent research revealed several molecules, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 and 3 proteins, insulin-receptor substrates 1 and 2, and other adipocytokines, potentially are involved in the development of insulin resistance in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Unfortunately, baseline insulin resistance has a negative impact on treatment outcomes in patients with chronic hepatitis C. However, successfully managing insulin resistance or diabetes mellitus in these patients may improve patients' likelihoods of successful outcomes with antiviral therapy. Likewise, eradication of hepatitis C virus in patients with insulin resistance or diabetes mellitus appears to improve glucose metabolism. Although adjunctive therapies such as insulin sensitizers and weight loss often are recommended, their ability to improve antiviral treatment response in patients with chronic hepatitis C is unproven. Studies are under way to determine whether improving insulin sensitivity results in better outcomes in patients receiving pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C.\",\"R1626, a prodrug of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA polymerase inhibitor R1479, showed time-dependent and dose-dependent reduction of HCV RNA levels in a previous study. The present study evaluated the efficacy and safety of R1626 administered for 4 weeks in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a +/- ribavirin in HCV genotype 1-infected treatment-naive patients. Patients were randomized to: DUAL 1500 (1500 mg R1626 twice daily [bid] + peginterferon alfa-2a; n = 21); DUAL 3000 (3000 mg R1626 bid + peginterferon alfa-2a; n = 32); TRIPLE 1500 (1500 mg R1626 bid + peginterferon alfa-2a + ribavirin; n = 31); or standard of care (SOC) (peginterferon alfa-2a + ribavirin; n = 20). At 4 weeks HCV RNA was undetectable (<15 IU/mL) in 29%, 69%, and 74% of patients in the DUAL 1500, DUAL 3000, and TRIPLE 1500 arms, respectively, compared with 5% of patients receiving SOC, with respective mean reductions in HCV RNA from baseline to week 4 of 3.6, 4.5, 5.2, and 2.4 log(10) IU/mL. Synergy was observed between R1626 and peginterferon alfa-2a and between R1626 and ribavirin. There was no evidence of development of viral resistance. Adverse events (AEs) were mainly mild or moderate; seven patients had nine serious AEs (including one patient with one serious AE in SOC). The incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia was 48%, 78%, 39%, and 10% in DUAL 1500, DUAL 3000, TRIPLE 1500, and SOC, respectively, and was the main reason for dose reductions.\",\"HCV-796 selectively inhibits hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In hepatoma cells containing a genotype 1b HCV replicon, HCV-796 reduced HCV RNA levels by 3 to 4 log(10) HCV copies/mug total RNA (the concentration of the compound that inhibited 50% of the HCV RNA level was 9 nM). Cells bearing replicon variants with reduced susceptibility to HCV-796 were generated in the presence of HCV-796, followed by G418 selection. Sequence analysis of the NS5B gene derived from the replicon variants revealed several amino acid changes within 5 A of the drug-binding pocket. Specifically, mutations were observed at Leu314, Cys316, Ile363, Ser365, and Met414 of NS5B, which directly interact with HCV-796. The impacts of the amino acid substitutions on viral fitness and drug susceptibility were examined in recombinant replicons and NS5B enzymes with the single-amino-acid mutations. The replicon variants were 10- to 1,000-fold less efficient in forming colonies in cells than the wild-type replicon; the S365L variant failed to establish a stable cell line. Other variants (L314F, I363V, and M414V) had four- to ninefold-lower steady-state HCV RNA levels. Reduced binding affinity with HCV-796 was demonstrated in an enzyme harboring the C316Y mutation. The effects of these resistance mutations were structurally rationalized using X-ray crystallography data. While different levels of resistance to HCV-796 were observed in the replicon and enzyme variants, these variants retained their susceptibilities to pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and other HCV-specific inhibitors. The combined virological, biochemical, biophysical, and structural approaches revealed the mechanism of resistance in the variants selected by the potent polymerase inhibitor HCV-796.\",\"Insulin resistance reduces the response to interferon alfa-based therapy of chronic hepatitis C patients. It has been speculated that improvement of insulin sensitivity might increase the chances of responding to treatment of such individuals.\",\"The nucleoside analog R1479 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of nonstructural protein 5B-directed hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in vitro. R1626, a tri-isobutyl ester prodrug of R1479, was developed to increase bioavailability and improve antiviral activity. A multicenter, observer-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose, phase 1b study was designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity and to potentially identify the maximum tolerated dose of R1626 in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Forty-seven treatment-na\\u00efve patients infected with HCV genotype 1 were treated with R1626 orally at doses of 500 mg, 1500 mg, 3000 mg, or 4500 mg or placebo twice daily for 14 days with 14 days of follow-up. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity were assessed. Doses up to and including 3000 mg twice daily were well tolerated after 14 days of treatment. There was an increase in frequency of adverse events at the highest dose (4500 mg). Reversible mild to moderate hematological changes were observed with increasing doses. R1626 was efficiently converted to R1479, with dose-proportional pharmacokinetics observed over the entire dose range. The pharmacokinetics of R1479 were linear over the dose range evaluated. Dose-dependent and time-dependent reductions in HCV RNA were observed. Mean decreases (median; range) in viral load after 14 days of treatment with doses of 500, 1500, 3000, and 4500 mg were 0.32 (0.22; 0.01-0.71), 1.2 (0.8; 0.49-2.46), 2.6 (2.7; 1.27-3.93) and 3.7 (4.1; 2.15-4.39) log(10), respectively. No resistance to R1479 was observed after 14 days of treatment with R1626.\",\"A substantial proportion of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-1b-infected patients still do not respond to interferon-based therapy. This study aims to explore a predictive marker for the ultimate virological response of HCV-1b-infected patients treated with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) combination therapy. Nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) sequences of HCV in the pretreated sera of 45 patients infected with HCV-1b were analyzed. The mean number of mutations in the variable region 3 (V3) plus its upstream flanking region of NS5A (amino acid 2334-2379), referred to as IFN/RBV resistance-determining region (IRRDR), was significantly higher for HCV isolates obtained from patients who later achieved sustained virological response (SVR) by PEG-IFN/RBV than for those in patients undergoing non-SVR. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis estimated six mutations in IRRDR as the optimal threshold for SVR prediction. Indeed, 16 (76%) of 21 SVR, but only 2 (8%) of 24 non-SVR, had HCV with six or more mutations in IRRDR (IRRDR > or = 6) (P < 0.0001). All of 18 patients infected with HCV of IRRDR of 6 or greater examined showed a significant (> or =1 log) reduction or disappearance of serum HCV core antigen titers within 24 hours after initial dose of PEG-IFN/RBV, whereas 10 (37%) of 27 patients with HCV of IRRDR of 5 or less did (P < 0.0001). The positive predictive value of IRRDR of 6 or greater for SVR was 89% (16/18; P = 0.0007), with its negative predictive value for non-SVR being 81% (22/27; P = 0.0008).\",\"Hepatitis C infection (HCV) remains a global problem and the current anti-HCV therapies available in the clinic have sustained virologic response rates (SVR) of only about 50%, especially in HCV genotype 1-infected subjects. The SVR is even lower in HIV-HCV co-infected patients, estimated at only about 30-40%. However, exciting new research is under way to find new anti-HCV therapies. Presently, efforts to develop new anti-HCV agents for HCV-infected persons who fail pegylated interferon and ribavirin-based therapies have focused on inhibitors of key HCV enzymes such as the HCV NS3 protease and the NS5B polymerase. There are two protease inhibitors, telaprevir (VX-950, Vertex) and boceprevir (SCH 503034, Schering-Plough); and three polymerase inhibitors, valopicitabine (NM283, Idenix), R1626 (Roche), and HCV-796 (Viropharma) that have advanced to late-stage clinical trials. Of these aforementioned agents, telaprevir is the most advanced in clinical development. Early trial results on efficacy, safety, and HCV drug-resistance profiles of these novel agents will be discussed in this review paper.\",\"Clinical significance of molecules involving innate immunity in treatment response remains unclear. The aim is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying resistance to antiviral therapy and predictive usefulness of gene quantification in chronic hepatitis C (CH-C).\",\"A phase 2, randomized, multicenter, open-label study evaluated the safety and efficacy of albinterferon alfa-2b in interferon-alpha treatment-na\\u00efve patients with genotype 2/3, chronic hepatitis C virus infection.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects approximately 3% of the world population. The chronicity of hepatitis C seems to depend on the level of genetic variability. We have recently (Torres-Puente et al., J Viral Hepat, 2008; 15: 188) reported genetic variability estimates from a large-scale sequence analysis of 67 patients infected with HCV subtypes 1a (23 patients) and 1b (44 patients) and related them to response, or lack of, to alpha-interferon plus ribavirin treatment.. Two HCV genome regions were analysed in samples prior to antiviral therapy, one compressing the three hypervariable regions of the E2 glycoprotein and another one including the interferon sensitive determining region and the V3 domain of the NS5A protein. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity measures showed a clear tendency to higher genetic variability levels in nonresponder than in responder patients. Here, we have refined the analysis of genetic variability (haplotype and nucleotide diversity, number of haplotypes and mutations) by considering their distribution in each of the biologically meaningful subregions mentioned above, as well as in their surrounding and intervening regions. Variability levels are very heterogeneous among the different subregions, being higher for nonresponder patients. Interestingly, significant differences were detected in the biologically relevant regions, but also in the surrounding regions, suggesting that the level of variability of the whole HCV genome, rather than exclusively that from the hypervariable regions, is the main indicator of the treatment response. Finally, the number of haplotypes and mutations seem to be better discriminators than haplotype and nucleotide diversity, especially in the NS5A region.\",\"To investigate the association between insulin resistance and rapid virologic response.\",\"This is a concise review of recent developments in the field of viral hepatitis, based on publications between December 2006 and November 2007.\",\"Ribavirin has a minor and transient effect on hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and has been suggested to select a novel mutation, F415Y, in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of subtype 1a viruses. Twenty-nine patients with chronic hepatitis C (subtyped by INNO LiPA as 1a, 17; 1b, 11; 1a/1b, 1) who were nonresponders to interferon-based therapies were identified retrospectively and screened at Baseline, week 24 of treatment, and 24 weeks post-treatment. Selection of resistance mutations, including at amino acid position 415 of the polymerase, was investigated. Using clonal sequencing and pyrosequencing of the NS5B gene, we screened for the F415Y resistance mutation among patients who received combination therapy with ribavirin and interferon \\u03b1. Of the 15 subtype 1a patients treated with interferon plus ribavirin, only one had the F415Y change at week 24, and an F/Y mixture was still present 24 weeks after therapy. Four additional patients in this group had the F415Y change 24 weeks post-therapy. The NS5B genes were sequenced in order to identify amino acid changes associated with ribavirin therapy, but no evidence was found that ribavirin selects for particular amino acids in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Ribavirin, a weak inhibitor of HCV replication, does not select for resistance mutations in the sequence of the HCV RNA polymerase.\",\"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a global health threat with approximately 200 million carriers worldwide. Current treatment consists of the use of peginterferon (pegIFN)/ribavirin (RBV) for 24 or 48 weeks depending on HCV genotype. Serious side effects and the fact that less than half of patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 4 (which are the most common) accomplish sustained virological response with this medication warrant the need for novel anti-HCV therapies.\",\"We previously reported the relationship between viral polymerase polymorphisms and the initial decline in viral load induced by interferon-alpha and ribavirin therapy in genotype 1b-related chronic hepatitis C patients. The presence of E124K and I85V of NS5B was closely associated with viral clearance at 8 weeks of treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms by which this polymorphism of NS5B protein affects early viral clearance. We used a replicon system derived from strain O, genotype 1b virus. Three mutants (V85I), (K124E), and (V85I/K124E) were introduced to the replicon. OR6c, a derivative of HuH7 cells, was transfected with the replicon including a luciferase reporter gene. Luciferase activities were measured 72 hr post-transfection. All three mutants showed higher luciferase activity than that of the wild type, and the V85I mutant showed the highest activity. This result was also confirmed by neomycin gene-containing replicons with same mutations. All replicons were down-regulated by ribavirin, but the level of reduction in the V85I mutant was the lowest. Our results suggested that this mutation at least partly contributes to resistance to early viral clearance during interferon and ribavirin combination therapy.\",\"The efficacy of treatment against hepatitis C virus has improved, but it is still far from ideal. Thus, new antihepatitis C virus therapies are required.\",\"While newer neuraminidase inhibitors have been used recently to treat influenza A and B virus infections, emergence of drug resistance poses potential problems. Previous ribavirin aerosol treatments of influenza were effective and drug resistance was not observed. To make ribavirin aerosol treatment a quicker process and limited to once or twice daily treatments, a MegaRibavirin formulation (100 mg of ribavirin/mL) was developed that when used with the Aerotech II nebulizer was effective in preventing death in a lethal influenza A virus mouse model. Aerosol generated using the Aerotech II nebulizer flowing at 10 L of air/min produced aerosol droplets that contained 2.3 mg of ribavirin/L with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 1.8 microm. Using this system for treatment, a single daily 30-min exposure on days 1-4 produced a survival rate of greater than 90%. Delaying the start of aerosol treatment for 48 or 72 h and treating once daily for 30 min for two days (days 2-3 and 3-4, respectively) still significantly increased the number of survivors and mean time to death. For the treatment of influenza in general and for pandemic avian influenza, the MegaRibavirin-Aerotech II method of aerosol treatment allows for short treatment periods, minimizes environmental issues and costs less.\",\"Interferon-alpha and ribavirin combined therapy has been a mainstream treatment for hepatitis C infection. The efficacy of this combined treatment is around 30% to 60%, and the factors affecting the responsiveness are still poorly defined. Our study is intended to investigate the genetic differences between responder and non-responder patients. The genome-wide linkage disequilibrium screening for loci associated with genetic difference between two patient groups was conducted by using 382 autosomal short tandem repeat (STR) markers involving 92 patients. We have identified 19 STR markers displaying different allele frequencies between the two patient groups. In addition, based on their genomic location and biological function, we selected the CD81 and IL15 genes to perform single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. In conclusion, this study may provide a new approach for identifying the associated polymorphisms and the susceptible loci for interferon-alpha and ribavirin combined therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C.\",\"Peginterferon with ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C leads to sustained loss of serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in half of treated patients. Although viral kinetic profiles in treatment responders shed light on the mechanism of action of interferon and ribavirin, minimal information is available to explain why some patients experience little or no virologic suppression.\",\"A novel small-molecule inhibitor, referred to here as R706, was discovered in a high-throughput screen of chemical libraries against Huh-7-derived replicon cells carrying autonomously replicating subgenomic RNA of hepatitis C virus (HCV). R706 was highly potent in blocking HCV RNA replication as measured by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting of R706-treated replicon cells. Structure-activity iterations of the R706 series yielded a lead compound, R803, that was more potent and highly specific for HCV replication, with no significant inhibitory activity against a panel of HCV-related positive-stranded RNA viruses. Furthermore, HCV genotype 1 replicons displayed markedly higher sensitivity to R803 treatment than a genotype 2a-derived replicon. In addition, R803 was tested by a panel of biochemical and cell-based assays for on-target and off-target activities, and the data suggested that the compound had a therapeutic window close to 100-fold, while its exact mechanism of action remained elusive. We found that R803 was more effective than alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) at blocking HCV RNA replication in the replicon model. In combination studies, R803 showed a weak synergistic effect with IFN-alpha/ribavirin but only additive effects with a protease inhibitor and an allosteric inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (20). We conclude that R803 and related heterocyclic compounds constitute a new class of HCV-specific inhibitors that could potentially be developed as a treatment for HCV infection.\",\"Viral breakthroughs (VB), defined as having detectable HCV VL while on anti-HCV therapy after achieving maximal suppression, have not yet been characterized with the use of PEG-IFN in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. We evaluated possible mechanisms for VB among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients receiving PEG-IFN/RBV. Thirty HIV/HCV coinfected patients were treated with PEG-IFN (1.5 mug/kg sc qwk) and RBV (1-1.2 g daily) for 48 weeks. Liver chemistry, HCV VL, genotyping, DNA microarray, and sequencing of HCV E-2 envelope were performed before and during treatment. VB had lower baseline HCV VL but higher ALT and AST than relapsers (ETR) (p < 0.05) and lower CD4+ T lymphocytes (%) than patients with sustained virological responses (SVR), but similar first and second phase HCV viral kinetics (vs. ETR and SVR; p > 0.05). HCV genotypes and envelope sequences were similar for patients with VB pretreatment and at break-through. VB had higher levels of interferon-induced gene (IFIG) expression pretreatment than patients with ETR (p < 0.01). HIV/HCV-coinfected patients have a high rate of VB on PEG-IFN/RBV therapy characterized by higher levels of IFIG expression, immunodeficiency, and hepatic inflammation. Novel strategies are required for the treatment of persons with VB.\",\"RNA viruses exhibit extraordinarily high mutation rates during genome replication. Nonnatural ribonucleosides that can increase the mutation rate of RNA viruses by acting as ambiguous substrates during replication have been explored as antiviral agents acting through lethal mutagenesis. We have synthesized novel N-6-substituted purine analogues with ambiguous incorporation characteristics due to tautomerization of the nucleobase. The most potent of these analogues reduced the titer of poliovirus (PV) and coxsackievirus (CVB3) over 1,000-fold during a single passage in HeLa cell culture, with an increase in transition mutation frequency up to 65-fold. Kinetic analysis of incorporation by the PV polymerase indicated that these analogues were templated ambiguously with increased efficiency compared to the known mutagenic nucleoside ribavirin. Notably, these nucleosides were not efficient substrates for cellular ribonucleotide reductase in vitro, suggesting that conversion to the deoxyriboucleoside may be hindered, potentially limiting genetic damage to the host cell. Furthermore, a high-fidelity PV variant (G64S) displayed resistance to the antiviral effect and mutagenic potential of these analogues. These purine nucleoside analogues represent promising lead compounds in the development of clinically useful antiviral therapies based on the strategy of lethal mutagenesis.\",\"No new therapy has been approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in the last 5 years in the USA since the approval of pegylated interferon (IFN)-alpha(2a) and ribavirin. Multiple new drugs are currently in development and are expected to be approved for use in the USA and/or the EU by 2011-2013. Although the mechanism of action of pegylated IFN and ribavirin are not completely known, it is likely that they will continue to be used in combination regimens for a number of years. Direct antivirals are likely to be the first new drugs to be used in combination with pegylated IFN and ribavirin. Viral resistance will prove to be a significant barrier and require that consolidation therapy with at least 24 weeks of pegylated IFN and ribavirin be used to successfully prevent the selection or emergence of resistant variants. Numerous other compounds, such as ribavirin analogs, long-acting IFNs, hepatoprotectants and immunomodulators, are in development and may replace the drugs that are used currently. The combination of direct antivirals, such as protease and polymerase inhibitors, may rapidly follow in development, as has occurred in HIV drug therapy.\",\"Liver transplantation is indicated in end-stage chronic viral liver disease, but unless adequate prophylaxis is administered, the patient will in most cases develop recurrent hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus infection. Today, patients receiving prophylaxis using nucleoside analogue drugs with or without specific immune globulin drugs in connection with orthotopic liver transplantation for HBV related cirrhosis, present low risk of relapse and high 5-10 year survival rates. Lamivudine was the first drug used in the prophylactic treatment, but this drug has increasingly been combined with or replaced by adefovir due to the low genetic barrier, which causes viral resistance. Most patients develop viral recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation for HCV related cirrhosis, and in an elevated number of cases, cirrhosis and hepatic insufficiency set in after a few years. Prophylaxis before transplantation and pre-emptive treatment using interferon and ribavirin present numerous side effects resulting in reduction of doses and suspension of therapy, with consequently low sustained virological remission rates and risk of rejection.The treatment is better tolerated by patients with histologically confirmed chronic disease, but also in these patients virological remission rates are low. This pathology requires new therapeutic protocols and/or new drugs in order to obtain better compliance and better responses.\",\"The quasispecies nature of hepatitis C virus (HCV) may have important implications concerning resistance to antiviral agents. To determine whether HCV NS5A quasispecies composition and dynamics are related to responsiveness to combined interferon (IFN) and ribavirin therapy, extensive sequence analyses of cloned RT-PCR amplification products of HCV-1b NS5A quasispecies of sequential isolates from 15 treated (nine sustained responders and six non-responders) and three untreated patients were performed. Accumulation of mutations in NS5A during therapy was relatively frequent in the V3 domain, but unusual elsewhere. Amino acid changes were the result of the imposition of minor variants that were already present before treatment and always occurred within the first week of therapy. Before treatment, the complexity and diversity of quasispecies were lower in isolates from responders than in those from non-responders, particularly in the V3 domain, where differences in nucleotide entropy (0.35 vs 0.64, P=0.003), genetic distance (0.0145 vs 0.0302, P=0.05) and non-synonymous substitutions (0.0102 vs 0.0203, P=0.036) were statistically significant. These differences became more apparent during treatment, because complexity and diversity remained stable or tended to increase in non-responders, whereas they tended to decrease in responders. These observations suggest that the composition and dynamics of HCV NS5A quasispecies, particularly in the V3 domain, may play a role in the response to combined IFN/ribavirin therapy.\",\"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) persists in the majority of infected individuals and is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic hepatitis C is currently treated with interferon (IFN)-alpha or with a combination of IFN-alpha and ribavirin. The availability of an HCV replicon system (Lohmann et al., SCIENCE: 285, 110-113, 1999) allowed the investigation of the effects of IFN on genuine HCV replication in cultured cells. It is shown here that IFN-alpha inhibits subgenomic HCV RNA replication in HuH-7 human hepatoma cells. Immunofluorescence, Western blot and Northern blot analysis revealed that levels of both HCV protein and replicon RNA were reduced after treatment with IFN-alpha in a dose-dependent manner. In further experiments, it was investigated whether MxA plays a role in the inhibition of HCV. The human MxA protein is an IFN-induced GTPase that has antiviral activity against various RNA viruses. However, HCV RNA replication was not affected in transfected HuH-7 cells that transiently overexpressed MxA. Moreover, a dominant-negative mutant of MxA did not interfere with the antiviral activity of IFN-alpha against HCV RNA replication.
